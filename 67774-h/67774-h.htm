<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> DISTINGUISHED member of the Lord Chamberlain’s
company, Mr. William Shakespeare by
name, had entered the shop of a tailor in the
town of Nottingham. This popular and respected actor
and playwright was about thirty-five years of age. Of
middle height, he had the compact figure of one in the
prime of a vigorous manhood. His hair was worn rather
long, but his beard, inclining to red in color, was trim
and close. His dress was plainer than is the rule with
those who follow his calling. Indeed at a first glance he
had less of the look of an actor than of a shrewd, cautious
man of affairs who has prospered in trade. Close
observation might have amended this estimate. There
was a vivid pallor about the face, and the somber eyes,
slow-burning and deep-set, were like a smoldering fire.
Even when the mobile features were in repose, which
was seldom the case, the whole effect of the countenance
was vital and arresting.</p>

<p>“That is a very choice coffin-cloth you have there,
Master Tidey.”</p>

<p>The manner of the actor and playwright was simplicity
itself. There was not a suspicion of affectation
in it. He passed his fingers over the rich pall that lay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>on the tailor’s knee. Upon the hem of the cloth an armorial
device was being stitched by the hand of a master
craftsman.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is Master Shakespeare,” said the tailor gravely.
“Choice enough, choice enough.”</p>

<p>“Who is the happy man?”</p>

<p>“A young gentleman who lies in the Castle yonder.
He is to have his head cut off a Tuesday by order of
the Queen.”</p>

<p>A look of startled interest came into the eyes of the
player. “Is that so, Master Tidey? And young, you say,
and gentle, too?”</p>

<p>“Aye, young enough. But two or three and twenty&mdash;by
all accounts a very fair and deliver young man.”</p>

<p>“It seems a pity,” said the player, “a mortal pity, for
a man to die by the ax in the heat of his youth. And
yet ’tis better to die by the ax than by the string. It is
at least a gentleman’s death the Queen is giving him,”
he added grimly.</p>

<p>“As you say,” the tailor agreed, “it is at least a gentleman’s
death the Queen is giving him, and he’ll have
the robe of a gentleman in which to wrap his corpse.
Happen, Master Shakespeare, that in like case it is a
better consideration than would fall to you and me.”</p>

<p>A light flashed in the somber eyes of the player. “Speak
for yourself Master Tidey,” he said, with a slow, deep
laugh. “Whenever I get my deliverance, by God’s grace
I’ll have the robe of a gentleman to cover me. Unless”&mdash;the
light in the somber eyes was so intense that they
shone almost black&mdash;“unless they let the reason out, and
then there’s no warrant for any man’s exit. But what
of this poor young man? How comes he to this?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>
<p>The tailor lowered his voice to a whisper. It was as
if he feared to be overheard. “They do say ’a has
plotted with the Papishers, who are always contriving
against the Queen.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of the unlucky youth?”</p>

<p>“His name is Mr. Gervase Heriot.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gervase Heriot! He is a kinsman of my Lord
Southampton.” A look of keen pity came upon the
player’s face. “I know the lad well enough. He sat on
our stage at The Globe less than two months ago. An
open, cheerful youth incapable of plotting against aught
save a flask of canaries, if I’m any judge of nature. Poor
young man. Master Tidey, this is a very tragic matter.”</p>

<p>“Sad enough, Master Shakespeare, sad enough,” said
the tailor, stitching busily at the coffin-cloth.</p>

<p>The actor passed a delicately shaped hand, the hand
of a poet, across his face. “More than once I have
marked the lad as he sat in the playhouse,” he said.
“’A was a proper neat youth. ’A had a subtle tongue
and a very flaming eye. ’A was german-cousin to Perseus,
him that bestrid the winged horse. And now&mdash;with
the taste of milk yet on his lips!” The player
ceased abruptly, as if overcome by a surge of feeling.
For a time he was silent. The tragic end of a youth
of bright promise appeared to weigh upon him sorely.</p>

<p>Master Nicholas Tidey, whose skill with the needle
and shears had spread far and wide over the midland
counties, was, like the player, a Stratford man. In a
rather shamefaced way, the tailor was a little inclined
to be proud of his fellow-townsman. To be sure his
calling was hardly that of a Christian. On occasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>his speech was apt to be a little disorderly, it even verged
upon the fantastical, but Master Tidey was bound to
admit that there must be something in the fellow. For
one thing, rumor had it that he had recently bought New
Place, the largest house in his native town. Such a
fact spoke for itself, even if a wise man was inclined
to discount the glowing reports of the play-actor’s ever-growing
success which reached him continually from
London. But, even as far back in the world’s history
as the age of Elizabeth, “Nothing succeeds like success”
was a maxim known to the philosophers.</p>

<p>“They do tell me, Master Shakespeare,” said the tailor,
“that some of these harlotry pieces of yours have been
approved by the Queen.”</p>

<p>The playwright could not help smiling a little at a
certain uneasiness which was apparent in the tone of
his friend, in spite of the fact that that honest man tried
very hard to conceal it. “If I said they had not, Master
Tidey,” he answered, with dry modesty, “I might
be speaking less than I know. On the other hand, if
I said that they had, a needy writer for the stage might
be claiming more than becomes the least of her Majesty’s
servants.”</p>

<p>Master Tidey looked a little incredulous. “They do
tell me, Master Shakespeare, that you make them out
of your own head entirely. Master Burbage, who was
here an hour ago to have new points set in his hose,
swore it was so, by the beard of the prophet&mdash;facetiously,
as I think. But I can hardly believe it, Master
Shakespeare, not out of your own head, and that’s the
fact. Why, I mind the time you was a little graceless
runnion that used to play truant from Stratford Free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>School. Many’s the time I’ve seen you come sliding down
Short Hill of a winter’s morning in your blue short
coat, with your books falling out o’ your satchel as you
dangled it behind you, and generally twenty minutes
late for the muster. You were always a sharp lad,
Master Shakespeare, I’m bound to say that although
somewhat idly given, but I never thought you’d have had
wit enough to make one of these interludes all out of
your own head like book-learned men who have been
bred at college.”</p>

<p>“It seems unlikely enough I grant you,” said the player
discreetly. “And my pieces, such as they are, don’t compare
of course with those of some I could mention&mdash;there
is a young fellow by the name of Ben Jonson, and one
of these days you’ll be able to contrive a whole garment
for the best of us out of his sleeve ruffles. But
I sometimes think, Master Tidey, when of an evening
I’ve had a glass o’ clear spring water with a carroway-seed
in it at the Mermaid Tavern, that if only he had
had the singular good fortune to have been bred at Oxford
or Cambridge, the world might one day have heard
of William Shakespeare&mdash;but no matter! It will all be
the same a hundred years hence.” The player laughed
cheerfully. “We shall all be forgotten, and our interludes
too, long before then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master Shakespeare, there can be no doubt
about that,” said the tailor heartily. “And personally
I thank God for it. I don’t hold with these masks and
gallimaufries and such-like cloaks for wantonness, saving
your presence. Still the Queen does, as I understand,
and although I am much surprised at <i>her</i>, that’s
a great matter. And that being the case I am bound to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>admit that for one who left the Stratford Free School
at the age of thirteen with no more book-knowledge
in his numskull than Daddy Jenkins could put there with
his ferrule, and if, as I say, the Queen approves your
interludes, and they are entirely out of your own head,
as Master Burbage swears they are by the beard of the
prophet&mdash;why, I am bound to admit that you bring little
or no discredit upon your native parish.”</p>

<p>“You pay me a high compliment, Master Tidey,” said
the actor. “And fain would I deserve it. But you will
grieve to learn, I am sure, that the Queen has commanded
the Lord Chamberlain’s servants to her palace
at Richmond on the tenth of July, and moreover she desires
a new piece from the pen of the least of them all.
It would seem that, for some reason at present obscure,
her Grace in her bounty is pleased to approve the nonsensical
comedy of “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” which, between
ourselves, is by no means the brightest of the performances
from the hand of the rustical clown in question.”</p>

<p>In spite of the strictness of his tenets, Master Tidey
could not forbear to be impressed. “You are indeed coming
to great honors now,” said the tailor, whose worldly
wisdom appeared to be in danger of overriding his high
principles. “And it is not for me to deny that you have
a talent&mdash;of a kind that is, Master Shakespeare. But
at least, as you are a Stratford man like myself, I am
glad to hear that there are those who think well of it.
What will you put into your comedy, Master Shakespeare?
Love, I presume, and all manner of wantonness?”</p>

<p>“Well, Master Tidey,” said the author, “since you
ask the question, you can no more leave love out of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>comedy than you can leave an apple out of a dumpling.
Besides, it is Gloriana’s desire that I should make her
a tale of love, that there should be youth in it and girlhood
and high poesy&mdash;that is, if we can rise to poesy in
this barren age! And it is Gloriana’s pleasure that it
shall be played before her of a summer’s afternoon under
the greenwood in Richmond Park.”</p>

<p>“You will be making your fortune one of these days,
Master Shakespeare,” said the tailor, upon the verge of
awe.</p>

<p>“That is as may be, Master Tidey. At least I would
ask nothing better than to quit the stage. A man’s
dignity and a player’s calling don’t ride well together.
In the meantime must I tease my five wits to devise a
play for Gloriana. And it must be made, alas! by the
tenth of July.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you had to do it than had I,” said the
tailor, with a sigh of relief, as he took up the needle
and shears.</p>

<p>By now the player was subdued to the process of
thought, and was twisting his short beard between his
thumb and forefinger. The eyes were veiled almost like
those of a man in a trance. “I’ve a mind to put Robin
Hood in it,” he said. “The bold outlaw of Sherwood
and his merry men. Many’s the time they have come
from the neighboring greenwood into this famous old
town of Nottingham.”</p>

<p>Before, however, the actor could pursue this pleasant
idea, there arose a sharp clatter of hoofs on the cobblestones
outside the tailor’s door, and a minute afterwards
a personage entered the shop who at once turned his
thoughts into a new direction.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE personage was a young woman of some eighteen
years, breathing youth and its sorcery in
every line. She was tall, well grown, of a beauty
that was remarkable. She stepped with a lithe grace,
a springing freedom that Atalanta would not have disdained.
Her long quilted riding-coat was the last cry
of the fashion, and on the left hand she wore a large
hawking-gauntlet. But that which at once caught the eye
both of the tailor and of the player, and made the charming
figure still more memorable, was an audacious pair
of leather breeches. These clothed her nether limbs, and
below them were a long pair of boots of untanned leather.</p>

<p>Now Master Tidey it was who had built this fine pair
of hawking-breeches to the explicit order of the wearer,
yet even he could hardly forbear to be scandalized when
he marked its effect. As for the player&mdash;but he had
a larger, a more liberal, a more sophisticated mind.
For one thing he had seen the fine ladies of the Court
ride out hawking in this guise. To be sure he had heard
some very salutary criticism of a style of dress that was
creeping into vogue among the highest in the land,
but he was not of those who condemned it. Mr. William
Shakespeare, unlike his friend Nicholas Tidey, betrayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>not the least surprise at this young woman’s appearance.
Certainly his curiosity was fully aroused, but perhaps
that was less on account of the garment itself than because
of the look of its wearer.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Mr. William Shakespeare, whose eye
was very sure in such matters, was charmed by the spectacle.
Swiftly he moved aside, in order that this young
gentlewoman might proceed to the tailor’s counter.
Moreover, as he performed this polite action he removed
his hat with a touch of gallantry, as became an
acquaintance with courts.</p>

<p>“Good Master Tailor,” said the wearer of the garment,
with an air so fine as to delight Mr. William
Shakespeare still more, “I make you my compliments
upon these hawking-breeches you have been so good as
to devise for me. They are a little tight around the
left knee, otherwise they do excellently well. I make
you my compliments upon them, Master Tailor, and have
the goodness to devise me a second pair in every particular
as the first.”</p>

<p>Master Tidey bowed obsequiously. “I attend your
pleasure, madam,” he said.</p>

<p>The young woman then drew off a glove, and with
some little difficulty was able to produce a purse from
the recesses of her attire. “What is your charge,
friend, for this excellent garment, which gives me such
ease in the saddle that from this day I am minded to
wear no other style of habiliment.”</p>

<p>“Two angels, if it please you, madam.”</p>

<p>“Here be four, my friend.”</p>

<p>She opened the purse and counted out in gold pieces
twice the sum that was asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>“Good Master Tailor,” she said, “you have right excellent
craft and your garment pleases me. And if I
must speak the truth, I had never learned until this day
what ease and freedom comes of the wearing of galligaskins.”</p>

<p>She used such a grave air, as of one expressing a most
serious and private thought, that Mr. William Shakespeare,
who all this time had been regarding her covertly,
although taking care to appear lost in contemplation of
the coffin-cloth the tailor had now discarded, could not
forbear from giving forth a dry, stealthy chuckle.</p>

<p>Mistress Anne Feversham half turned for the purpose
of visiting such a presumption with an imperious
eye. The clear gaze said as plainly as woman could express
it: “And who, pray, are you, sir? Whoever you
are I’ll thank you to be pretty careful.”</p>

<p>Howbeit, in the matter of looking down this presumptuous
individual, young Mistress Anne Feversham, it
seemed, had undertaken a task a little beyond her present
powers. There was hardly one among the burgesses
of the town who could have sustained that gaze.
But with this quiet and mild-looking individual, whose
coat and sword were so modest, it was a different matter.</p>

<p>The impact of the proud eyes of Mistress Insolence
was met with perfect composure. Moreover, there was
just a suspicion of laughter. In the opinion of the lady
there was no ground for levity. Yet it was almost as if
this person, whose dress was so little pretentious as to
be hardly that of a gentleman, was daring to say in his
heart, “Madam, think not ill of me if I confess that,
far from being abashed by your air, I am rather amused
by it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p>That at least was the quick and sensitive feminine interpretation
of the subtle face whose owner was hardly
entitled to such a look of arch and humorous self-confidence.
Mistress Anne Feversham felt a slight wound
in her dignity. Who, pray, was this impertinent?</p>

<p>By some means best known to himself, Mr. William
Shakespeare appeared to read the thoughts of the lady.
At least the sly smile that had crept into those somber
but wonderful eyes had deepened to a look of roguery.
Mistress Anne grew crimson; the disdainful head went
up; she bit her lip; and then realizing that such a display
of embarrassment was wholly unworthy of the
daughter of the Constable of Nottingham Castle, the
pride of youth chastened her so sorely that she turned
her back abruptly on the cause of her defeat.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the ever-abiding sense of place and
power came to her aid and she was able to command
herself sufficiently to address the tailor.</p>

<p>“I see the town is full of play-acting rogues,” she said.
“Whence do they come?”</p>

<p>“From London, madam, I believe,” said Master Tidey,
without venturing to look in the direction of his friend.</p>

<p>“I am afraid they are a saucy-looking crew. My
groom”&mdash;perhaps it was well that the voice of Mistress
Anne did not reach the ears of the haughty young falconer
who was taking charge of her horse at the tailor’s
door&mdash;“my groom pointed them out to me as I passed
the Moot Hall. As soon as I return to the Castle I will
inform my father the Constable, and I will see if they
cannot be put in the stocks, which to my mind is where
they belong.”</p>

<p>As became the shrewd man he was, Master Nicholas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>Tidey made no reply. He was content to nod his head
gravely, as if he tacitly approved, while at the same time
he contrived to keep a tail of an eye upon his distinguished
friend. There might or there might not have
been a ghost of a smile upon that prim and cautious
mouth.</p>

<p>Indeed, very wisely, Master Tidey left it to the play-actor
himself to try a fall with such a formidable
adversary. And this that daring individual proceeded
to do in a manner quite cool and leisurely, and yet with
a vastly considered air. In his eye, it was true, there
was a suspicion of something far other than gravity.
That of course was regrettable; but it was undoubtedly
there.</p>

<p>Mr. William Shakespeare’s first act was to remove
his hat with its single short cock’s feather, and then he
bowed very low indeed, in the manner of one quite well
aware of addressing a social superior.</p>

<p>“Cry you mercy, mistress,” he said, “but as one who
is himself a poor actor may he ask wherein his guild
has had the unhappiness to offend you?”</p>

<p>Mistress Anne Feversham met this effrontery with a
disdain that was wonderful. Her chief concern at the
moment was to show her great contempt without a descent
into downright ill-breeding. But as soon as she
met the somber eyes of this individual, in which a something
that was rare and strange was overlaid by a subtle
mockery, this natural instinct took wings and fled. In
those eyes was something that hardly left her mistress
of herself, in spite of her father the Constable, her
young blood-horse and her incomparable pair of galligaskins.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>“My father the Constable would have all play-actors
whipped,” said Mistress Anne Feversham.</p>

<p>But her voice was not as she had intended it to be.
Moreover, her father the Constable had yet to deliver
himself of such an illiberal sentiment. And this graceless
individual seemed to be fully aware that this was
the case.</p>

<p>“Whipped, mistress!” His look of grave consternation
did not deceive her. “You would whip a poor actor!”</p>

<p>“All who are actors, sir, my father would.”</p>

<p>“Is it conceivable?&mdash;the gentlest, the humblest, the
most industrious, the most law-abiding of men!”</p>

<p>“My father cares not for that, sir. He says they are
masterless rogues.”</p>

<p>“Then by my faith, mistress, that is very froward in
your father.”</p>

<p>“He says they are the scum of taverns and alehouses
and they corrupt the public mind.”</p>

<p>“Ods my life! how comes so crabbed a sire to have a
daughter so fair, so feat, so charming!”</p>

<p>It began to seem hopeless for Mistress Anne to continue
in such a strain of severity. For a moment she
used her will in order to punish this audacity, but in
the next she was trembling upon the verge of open
laughter. Still the consciousness that she was no less a
person than the only daughter and heiress of Sir John
Feversham, the Constable of Nottingham Castle and chief
justice of the forest of Sherwood, was just able to save
her from that which could only have been regarded in the
light of a disaster.</p>

<p>“I would fain inform you, mistress, there are play-actors
whom even the Queen approves.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>Alas! Mistress Anne had a full share of the cynical
irreverence of youth.</p>

<p>“I am not at all surprised to learn that, sir. I have
even been told that the Queen dyes her hair.”</p>

<p>The effect of a speech so daring was to startle Master
Tidey quite visibly. The world looks to one of his craft
to have a conventional mind, and there was no doubt
the times were perilous. The shears almost fell from his
hand. If this was not treason, might he never sew another
doublet!</p>

<p>The play-actor, however, was of a fiber less delicate.
It was as much as Mr. William Shakespeare could do to
refrain from open laughter.</p>

<p>“May I ask, mistress,” he said, “what is your warrant
for such a grave charge against the Queen’s Majesty?”</p>

<p>“The warrant of my own eyes, sir. Her hair was
certainly dyed when she stayed at the Castle a month
since.”</p>

<p>“But bethink you, mistress, might it not appear less
treasonable if Gloriana’s true subjects presumed her hair
to be a wig?”</p>

<p>“Let them presume nothing, sir, but that which is the
truth.”</p>

<p>“To so pious a resolve even a poor actor may say
amen.”</p>

<p>Mistress Anne realized that she was no match for this
man. The only hope for her dignity lay in a cool scorn
of him. Suddenly the gloriously straight back was
turned disdainfully. Let the greatest lady for ten miles
beware how she chopped logic with a strolling actor.</p>

<p>“Master Tailor, I would have you devise me a second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>pair of these right excellent breeches, in every particular
as the first, and do you have them at the Castle
against the first of May.”</p>

<p>Master Tidey bowed low.</p>

<p>“Good-day to you, Master Tailor.”</p>

<p>Master Tidey bowed still lower with that clear and
proud speech in his ears.</p>

<p>With chin held high, and with an arrogant, free-swinging
carriage, Mistress Anne Feversham went forth
of the tailor’s shop. But even then, abrupt as was the
manner of her going, she had to submit to the play-actor’s
leaping to the door before she could reach it herself.
He opened it and held it for her with the grace and
dignity of a courtier. She passed imperiously, without
yielding him a glance or a “Thank you.”</p>

<p>A dashing young man in the livery of a falconer was
holding the young blood-horse of Mistress Anne outside
the tailor’s door. He was handsomely mounted on an
animal similar to the one he held for his mistress. On
his fist was a small falcon, hoodwinked and fessed.</p>

<p>Very agile was the lady in finding her way into the
saddle. For all that she was not quite clever enough to
defeat this incorrigible play-actor. He sprang to her
stirrup while she had one foot still on the ground and
hoisted her up with an address that enforced her respect,
and with so grave an air of courtesy as tacitly to compel
her own.</p>

<p>All the same she was angry. And she had sense
enough to know that it was illogical to be so. Yet
she swung her horse around sharply in order to give
expression to her state of mind. And as the falconer,
John Markham by name, confided the merlin to the accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
wrist of his mistress, he turned back an instant
to scowl at the player. It was even as if he would
ask him who the devil he was, and what the devil he
did there.</p>

<p>The player removed his hat with its single cock’s
feather in a manner that was almost tenderly ironical.
It had hardly been a display of Court manners of which
he had been the recipient. But he was too much a man
of the world to look for those everywhere. And above
all here was youth in its glamour, youth in its sorcery.
For the sake of a stuff so precious he would forgive
a crudity greater than this.</p>

<p>With a sigh of delight the player stood at the tailor’s
door to watch this fine pair ride very slowly and haughtily
down the street. For all their air of class consciousness
and their open contempt of the townspeople, which
their youth alone saved from being ridiculous, they made
a glorious pair in the eye of the part-proprietor of the
Globe Theatre, London.</p>

<p>That was an eye to judge men and things as none
other since the world began. Neither Mistress Anne
Feversham nor the falconer was aware of that fact,
and had they been aware of it they had not cared a
button. All that they did know and all that they cared
was that the worthy burgesses of Nottingham were stealing
glances of awe and admiration at them. In a word,
they were causing a sensation, and were very pleasantly
alive to the fact.</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly a gallant pair. John Markham, in
spite of his superior condition and rising renown, rode
behind his mistress at a respectful distance of ten yards.
They sat their horses with great skill and assurance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>First one and then the other, as they walked them
slowly down the street, would touch them gently with
the spur, in order to enjoy the pleasure of showing them
off in the sight of the townspeople.</p>

<p>The player, still standing at the tailor’s door, could
not take his eyes from the spectacle. Almost wistfully,
and yet in a kind of entrancement, he watched them
until at last there came a turn in the street and they
were lost to view. Then he went within to rejoin his
scandalized friend, who to compose his mind had had recourse
already to the needle and shears.</p>

<p>“I never saw the like o’ that,” said Master Nicholas
Tidey. “It’s rare to be the quality. But that’s nothing
to you, Master Shakespeare. I reckon you see it every
day o’ the week.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine thing, I grant you, when it rides proud in
the sight of heaven,” said the player abstractedly.</p>

<p>“Aye, Master Shakespeare, and even when it goes
afoot!” said the tailor, whose mind was more pedestrian.
“It does a man good, I always think, to have a sight
of the quality now and again. But as I say, Master
Shakespeare, it is nothing to you who go to Court like a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>But the part-proprietor of the Globe Theatre was not
heeding the words of his friend. The light that never
was on sea or land had come into those somber eyes.
Suddenly his hand struck the tailor’s counter a great
blow. “That is an adorable miniard,” he said. “By
my soul, if Gloriana requires a comedy, here is matter
for a comedy for Gloriana!”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the meantime, the unconscious cause of Mr. William
Shakespeare’s enthusiasm was proceeding
somewhat arrogantly through the streets of the
town. Mistress Anne Feversham was mightily proud of
herself, of her young blood-horse, of her pied merlin,
above all of her brand-new hawking-breeches, which
she had had the audacity to copy from two particularly
dashing ladies of the Court who had accompanied the
Queen on her recent visit to Nottingham.</p>

<p>As for John Markham, she was proud of him too. He
made a fine squire. But nothing would have induced
her to let him know it. None the less surely was
he subdued to her purposes. A wise fellow in all
things else, he was the true knight, the ready slave of
his young mistress. And his young mistress was imperious.</p>

<p>High temper was in every clean-run line of her. It
was in the eye, a thing of mist and fire, gloriously
placed like that of one of Leonardo’s ladies. It was in
the nose, curved like the beak of her merlin; in the
delicate molding of the chin and mouth, in the slender
column of the throat, in the poise of the head, in the
supple assurance of the body which ruled a beast of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>mettle and goaded it into setting up its will for the
pleasure of subduing it.</p>

<p>John Markham, with a head beyond his years, was
passing wise for his station. He was no ordinary servant,
but one high in the regard of Sir John Feversham,
the Constable of Nottingham Castle, that grim pile half-a-mile
off, rising sheer from its rock in the midst of the
water-meadows. Learned in hawking, he was esteemed
by gentle and simple for many a mile. His skill in the
craft of princes had even carried his fame as far as
Belvoir, under whose shadow he had been bred. He
was a shrewd, a skilful, a bold young fellow, wise in
all things except that he worshiped the ground upon
which his young mistress trod.</p>

<p>That was the fault of his youth. He had been less
than he was, far less, could he have attended her pleasure
without dreaming of her in the long watches of the
night, or desiring in his hours of madness that she
should plunge into his heart the silver-hilted poniard
she wore at her waist. This was her eighteenth birthday,
and he was rising twenty-five. She was rich, important,
beautiful, capricious. For she was the only
child and heiress of the greatest man for ten miles round.</p>

<p>And he, who was he? Well, if the truth must be told,
he was the byblow of a kitchen-wench and one of great
place who had shown him not a spark of kindness. Yes,
if the truth must be told&mdash;and John Markham thanked
no man for telling it&mdash;born and bred under the shadow
of Belvoir, given the soul and the features of a noble
race, but without birth, favor or education, except that
he was learned in hawking. Encased in that fine livery
was a strong, tormented soul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<p>His young mistress never allowed him to forget that
he was a servant. In her gentlest moods she would
throw her words to him as if he had been a dog. She
knew he was her slave, happy only in his chains, one
barred by fortune from an equality she could never forgive
his not being able to claim. His passive acceptance
of the bar seemed to make her cruel. He was so tall, so
brave, so handsome; not a man in all the county of
Notts could cast a main of hawks like him. Only a
month ago the Queen had praised him to his face. Yet
was he like a hound that came to heel at her word, or
a horse that took sugar out of her hand without hurting
it. In the presence of others he could be proud enough,
but in hers he was as humble as the meanest of her servants,
who asks only to be allowed to wait upon her will.</p>

<p>At this moment, be it said, the will of Mistress Anne
was making John Markham decidedly unhappy. It had
done so indeed for a fortnight past. In the Queen’s train
during her recent visit to Sir John, his master, at the
Castle, had come the ladies of her household. Among
these had been two who, not to put too fine a point upon
the matter, had given Mistress Anne ideas. Brazenly
enough as it had seemed to chaste minds, yet it was to
be feared with the sanction of their august mistress, had
they gone a-hawking in the meadows astride their horses,
the nether woman arrayed in brown leather galligaskins!</p>

<p>Honest John Markham was not alone in his horror of
so sad a spectacle. More than one graybeard had wagged
over it in the buttery; more than one prim kirtle had
lamented it bitterly in the hall. What were the women
of England coming to, if the highest in the land&mdash;! The
matter was one scarce fit for persons of delicacy. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>such a practice spread, who should say to what heights
ere long the vaunting spirit of woman would aspire?</p>

<p>Alas! the matter had not ended here. Mistress Anne,
in the very insolence of daring, had seen the last word
in modishness in this most perilous innovation. Nothing
would content her but that she should have a pair of
leather hawking-breeches for her wear. John Markham,
that trusty henchman, was sent at once to Master Nicholas
Tidey, the man’s tailor of Nottingham, with careful
instructions from his mistress.</p>

<p>She was not able herself to visit that worthy, because
she had been expressly forbidden by her father to pass
through the town gate. Thus had the task been laid
upon John Markham of haranguing the accomplished
Master Tidey. And in the last resort he summoned that
famous craftsman in person to the Castle, since it presently
appeared that there are subtleties in the design of a
pair of hawking-breeches which cannot be dealt with
by third parties. Finally John it was who bore the
sinister parcel into the Castle under cover of night, carrying
it with his own faithful hands into the presence of
the lady on the eve of the eighteenth anniversary of
her birth.</p>

<p>Truly a very perilous innovation. Honest John did
not go beyond that. Whether that other honest John,
his master, from whom she derived her over-riding temper,
would be content with such a moderation&mdash;well,
that was a matter that the future would soon be called
upon to decide.</p>

<p>Mistress Anne, riding slowly down the street ten yards
ahead of the falconer, checking her blood-horse, Cytherea,
with one hand and holding her pied merlin in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>other, was a picture to haunt the young man’s dreams for
many a day to come. Already she had much skill in
the art he had taught her: she could bring down her bird
with the best; she sat her horse like a young goddess;
the galligaskins of supple brown leather&mdash;alas! that was
a subject to which the honest fellow durst not lend his
mind.</p>

<p>As they rode through the town, many a sly glance
was stolen at the wearer of the brown leather galligaskins.
But the expression on the face of the falconer
said clearly enough: “Be wary of your gaze, my masters.
There is a broken costard for any who are froward of
eye.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mistress Anne made a nine days’ wonder
in the ancient borough of Nottingham. Presently
the town was behind them. Instead of returning straight
to the Castle, they made for the open meadows all spread
with blue and white and yellow crocuses, which in the
spring of the year weave their vivid carpet by the banks
of Trent. Soon they had come to the narrow wooden
bridge that spanned the broad and deep river. John
Markham’s horse, young and half-broken, suddenly took
exception to the quick-flowing torrent under its feet.
It swerved so sharply that it all but threw him.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of the fierce scuffle, Mistress Anne
looked back. She was in time to see John struggling
to regain the saddle from which he had so nearly parted
company. “Clumsy fellow!” she cried. “You sit your
horse like a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>While she was in the act of finding a figure of speech
to meet the case, her own horse realized its opportunity.
Nor was it slow to turn it to account. Cytherea made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>a thoroughly competent attempt to pitch her rider into
the river. She just failed, it is true, but that was more
because her luck was out than for any lack of honest
intention.</p>

<p>Cytherea’s bold rider was no believer in half measures.
She soon had her in hand, duly admonished her with
shrewd jabs of her long spurs and came a second time
within an ace of being flung into the river. Not brooking
cold steel, Cytherea fought for her head like a tigress.
She got her forefeet onto the low rail of the bridge.
There was a desperate moment of uncertainty, in which
the issue hung in the balance, and then Cytherea had to
bring her forefeet down again.</p>

<p>“The fault is yours, John Markham,” said Cytherea’s
rider. “You are, I say, a clumsy fellow. You sit your
horse like a&mdash;” Again she paused to find a simile worthy
of the occasion. “You sit your horse like a sack of peas.”</p>

<p>John did not reply, but hung his diminished head.</p>

<p>“Here, take the merlin,” said his mistress, and by
now there was a steady light in her eyes. “And give me
that whip of yours.”</p>

<p>But the falconer, fully conscious of his daring, summoned
all his courage. “Wait till we are across the
bridge, I pray you, mistress.”</p>

<p>“Give me your whip, sirrah. If this rude beast gets
me into the river I’ll warrant she comes in herself.”</p>

<p>“No, mistress,” said the falconer. “I dare not. The
rail is too low and the bridge is too narrow.”</p>

<p>“Hand it to me at once, I say!” The face of Cytherea’s
wilful rider was full of menace.</p>

<p>Never before had the falconer dared to oppose her
will, but it was almost certain death if now he obeyed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Do you not hear me, sirrah?”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, mistress, as soon as we are across
the bridge.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to wait until they had
gained the opposite bank. Once among the crocuses,
the lady reined in the still mutinous Cytherea with no
light hand. She then turned her unruly steed to meet
that of the falconer.</p>

<p>“Now, sirrah!”</p>

<p>The gauntleted hand was held out grimly. The eyes
were like stars in their dark luster; and in the center
of each cheek burned a glowing crimson.</p>

<p>John Markham lifted the merlin from the fist of his
mistress. Then he gave her the whip. There was not
a drop of blood in his cheeks. His fixed, unfearing
gaze had not a shade of defiance; but it was as if the
upturned face almost invited that which awaited it.</p>

<p>“You fool!”</p>

<p>The whip descended sharply, but without haste, on
the lithe and beautiful flanks of the astonished Cytherea.
One, two, three. It was a hazardous proceeding. For
more than one long minute the issue lay in doubt. But
skill and high courage gained the day. The dignity of a
daughter of men was vindicated at the expense of the
dignity of the daughter of goddesses.</p>

<p>“I thank you, John Markham.”</p>

<p>She returned the whip to the falconer with almost an
air of kindness.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS was a brave thing, already out to set up its
will against the world. And of the little world
in which she lived her father was the center of
authority. He was an august man, high in the service
of the Queen. His explicit word was not lightly to be
disobeyed. And it had gone forth with no uncertainty.
Upon no pretext must Mistress Anne Feversham enter
the town of Nottingham, which nestled close about the
Castle rock.</p>

<p>But she was eighteen years old this day, of a head-strong
blood, motherless, craving adventure. The fire
in her veins was mounting high. It must have an outlet,
it must find escape from within the grim precincts
of that old fortress which had begun to press upon her
life.</p>

<p>Alas! as they returned to the Castle after an hour’s
larking among the crocuses, John Markham’s heart sank.
He had been a party to a forbidden thing. And he
knew not what pains, what penalties might overtake the
charming culprit if her naughtiness came to his master’s
ear. Moreover, a share of the consequences was like
to fall upon himself. But the falconer was not the
man to care very much about that. He would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>asked nothing better than to be allowed to pay the whole
of that reckoning which he knew very well was bound
sooner or later to confront his young mistress.</p>

<p>That young woman fully realized her guilt. Yet she
was far from being afraid. Indeed, as they rode back
in the glow of the April sunset to the stern house which
kept the old town in awe, she was like a strong-winged
bird that knew already the power of its pinions. The
brief and sharp battle with Cytherea, whose end had been
a proper mending of manners for that unruly beast, had
put her in great heart. She was keen for a further
display of her powers. Never had she used her servant
with such a magnanimity, never with such a humorous
indulgence.</p>

<p>It was as if she would say to all the world: “See what
a will I have. Be it known to all men it is vain for any
to oppose it.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless John Markham was sad at heart. Out
of his high devotion to her she might command him anything,
but well he knew there could only be one end to
this overweening mood. The galligaskins were a sore
matter, although the Constable had not seen them yet.
As for the visit to the town, it was neither more nor less
than an open flout to his authority. John had a troubled
heart as they passed through the Castle gate.</p>

<p>As if to confirm the falconer in his fears, Mistress
Anne was informed by the porter of the lodge as they
passed through the gate that the Constable desired her
immediate presence in his own apartment.</p>

<p>“For what purpose does he seek it?” The question
was asked with the impatience of a spoiled child.</p>

<p>“I know not, mistress,” said the porter gravely. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>do but know that when the Constable returned from
his ride in the town he asked for you and left the message
I have given.”</p>

<p>“When did Sir John return?”</p>

<p>“Not an hour ago, mistress.”</p>

<p>In the courtyard, with an air of resolute laughter,
Mistress Anne yielded her horse to the falconer’s care.
Unabashed, in her amazing garment, which set off her
long-flanked slenderness adorably, she strode into the
great house. The fine, free gait was not without a
suspicion of a manly swagger, which the Queen’s ladies
had also affected. Boldly and fearlessly she entered the
presence of the august Sir John Feversham.</p>

<p>The Constable was seated alone in his dark-paneled
room. It was easy to see whence came his young daughter’s
handsome looks and strength of will. It was a
face that few of that age could have matched for power
and masculine beauty. The gray eyes had a very direct
and searching quality, the forehead was lofty and ascetic;
indeed the man’s whole aspect proclaimed that
here was one who had learned many high secrets not only
of the body, but of the soul.</p>

<p>This was not a man to be trifled with, and none
knew that better than his daughter. But this unhappy
day she was a young woman overborne by a sense of
her own consequence.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, Sir John.” The voice was half
defiance, half disdain.</p>

<p>“Yes, mistress, I did so.”</p>

<p>The tones of the Constable were a deep, slow growl.
They were used in a way of such reluctance that it
seemed a pain to utter them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>“Wherefore, Sir John, did you send for me?” The
half-humorous tones were all of innocence.</p>

<p>The Constable’s reply was a grave stroking of the
chin. The stern gaze began very slowly to traverse
the culprit as she stood in all her sauciness, in all her
defiance. Not a detail of her manners or of her attire
escaped those grim eyes. “Why did I send for you?
Do you venture to ask the question?”</p>

<p>In spite of her reckless courage the tones sent little
shivers through Mistress Anne.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir John, I do.” She had summoned all that
she had of boldness.</p>

<p>“As you dare to ask the question, I will answer it.”
It was as if the Constable turned over each word very
carefully in his stern heart before it was born upon his
grim lips. “First I would say to you, daughter, there
is a long and ever-growing accompt between you and
me which has begun to cry aloud for a settlement. I
ask you, is it not so?”</p>

<p>Mistress Anne was silent. Even her strength of will
had begun at last to fail before this slow-gathering vehemence.
Once before, and once only, had she heard that
tone in her father’s voice. Many years had passed
since then, but on hearing it again the occasion suddenly
came back to her, bringing with it a kind of vivid
horror.</p>

<p>“Is it not so, I ask you?”</p>

<p>The tone was that of a judge.</p>

<p>“Daily have I marked a growing frowardness, daily
have I marked a higher measure of your impudency.”
The careful words had no unkindness. “It is but a
week since these ears heard you mock at the color of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>the hair of the Queen’s most gracious majesty. Is it
not so?”</p>

<p>Mistress Anne had no wish to deny that.</p>

<p>“And now to-day do I find you tricked out in a manner
whose wicked unseemliness passes all belief. Furthermore,
in open defiance of my command, you have
entered the town. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>The culprit had no word now. The imperious valor
was routed utterly.</p>

<p>“I do fear me,” said the Constable, “you are in the
toils of a disease which admits only of the sharpest
remedy. Week by week have I remarked an ever-growing
sauciness. It is a malady which in man or woman,
horse or hound, can only be met in one way.”</p>

<p>The Constable rose slowly from his chair. He was
a tall, powerful man, and very formidable and even terrible
he looked. He took down a heavy hunting-whip
which hung from a nail on the wall. His daughter had
not imagination enough to be terrified easily. Moreover
for her years she had a particularly resolute
will. It was this that an imminent peril restored to
her.</p>

<p>“I will not be beaten,” she said, with proud defiance.
“This day I am eighteen years old. This day I am a
woman, and being a woman I will do in all things as
it pleases me.”</p>

<p>The Constable ran the long whip through his fingers.
“Oh and soh, mistress,” said he, “this day you claim
the estate of womanhood. And having come to that
high condition you put forth a modest claim to do in
all things as you would. Well, I am bound to say
I have heard that a number of the women of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
age have these froward ideas. But it is new to me
that there are any so vain as to practice them.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore should they not, Sir John?” The clear
and brave eyes of his daughter were fixed on his own.
“Is it not that in all things a woman is the equal of a
man, as the Queen herself has shown, always except in
those wherein she is a man’s superior?”</p>

<p>Again the Constable caressed the whip as though he
loved it. “These be very perilous ideas,” he said. “I
had not thought this canker had bit so deep. Of all the
diseases that afflict our sorry age I believe there is none
so vile as that which leads a young gentlewoman of careful
and modest nurture to speeches of such an idle
vanity. As I am a Christian man I can hardly believe
my ears.”</p>

<p>“Sir John, it is the truth I speak. And has not the
Queen herself approved it?”</p>

<p>“Nay, mistress, I would have you use that name more
modestly,” said the Constable. But now in his eyes was
a light that turned her cold.</p>

<p>Very gently the great thong was being shaken out.
The long and cruel length was uncoiling itself like that
of a serpent, so that now it lay crouching in wait among
the rushes of the floor.</p>

<p>“I will not be beaten,” was all that Anne could gasp.
“I am this day a woman.”</p>

<p>With a sudden chill of despair she knew that she was
helpless. And if she had not known, in the very next
instant that cruel fact would have been revealed to her.
With a surprising dexterous swiftness for which she
was not prepared, the slender wrist was twisted in a lock
so cunning that to struggle would be to break the arm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>“As I am a Christian man it is my duty to cut away
so damnable a heresy.” The sharp, hissing words came
through shut teeth.</p>

<p>The defenceless form was held at arm’s length. In
the implacable eyes of the Constable was the sinister
fanaticism which is not afraid to wound itself.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">“O</span>H, mistress!”</p>

<p>A voice that had music in it sounded from the
top of the high wall.</p>

<p>Anne had spent a dreadful night of pain and misery
in one of the milder of the Castle dungeons. That
is to say, it was above the ground. Also it was free of
vermin, it was tolerably well lit, and was provided with
a small inclosed yard open to the sky, but surrounded by
a high wall garnished with spikes. Her first night of
womanhood had been of a bitterness she had not thought
it possible to know. There had only been a crust of bread,
a jug of water and a bare pallet to assuage her tears.
She had crept out of her cell in the darkness, and at last,
quite exhausted, had fallen asleep under the April stars,
with but a slab of icy stone to ease her hurts.</p>

<p>But now the dawn was come, and from far overhead a
charming voice saluted her waking ears.</p>

<p>She looked up. A fair head crowned with morning
was thrust between the close-set spikes. A young man
with the bravest eyes in the world was gazing down compassionately
upon her.</p>

<p>“Oh, mistress!”</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily she drew the cloak which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>been given her the closer about her aches. But it was not
possible to conceal her pathetic, her terrible distress.</p>

<p>“Oh, mistress!”</p>

<p>For the third time the charming voice saluted her ears,
not mockingly, not unkindly, not even curiously. In it
was a gentleness, a subtle power of sympathy that, do as
she would, started her tears anew. She drew the cloak
closer about her shoulders, as if by so doing she could
conceal the fact that she had been used very grievously.</p>

<p>“You have been a-weeping, mistress.”</p>

<p>It was idle to deny a fact so plain.</p>

<p>Yesterday she would have met this boldness in a very
different way. But that was past. In one long night of
intolerable anguish her very nature had suffered a
change.</p>

<p>“For why do you weep, mistress?”</p>

<p>Again was the voice like music. She could not forbear
to look up into the dawn, which framed with its
golden rose a fair head and a pair of brave, honest and
gentle eyes.</p>

<p>“Is it for a grievous fault? Nay, but I am sure it is
not.”</p>

<p>The tone was all kindness, all concern. Besides, there
was some strange magic in it that had never sounded in
her ears until that hour.</p>

<p>“Never tell me, mistress, that you are to have your head
cut off on Tuesday by order of the Queen.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken in a manner almost whimsical.
But as, startled and perhaps a little terrified, she gazed
up to meet those eyes she suddenly saw that unutterable
things lay behind their laughter.</p>

<p>The words, the look seemed almost to sicken her. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>then like a strong wine a thrill of compassion ran in her
veins. She rose to her feet unsteadily. Her body was
so weak that she had to lean it against the wall. A thousand
intolerable aches returned. She opened her lips to
speak, but her voice was mute.</p>

<p>Looking down upon her distress, the eyes of the young
man were as full of compassion as her own. The face
of the girl was stained and swollen with tears; she could
hardly check a groan when she moved; the cloak slipping
from her shoulders revealed under the torn bodice the
cruel marks of the whip.</p>

<p>“Oh, mistress!” The voice was tender as the missel-thrush.
“What was your fault that this should have
been done to you? But whatever it was, sweet mistress,
you have had savage payment.”</p>

<p>Even as she hid her own she knew that the gentle eyes
were brimming with pity.</p>

<p>But what were these slight aches of hers in the comparison
with his own grim pass? On Tuesday he was to
have his head cut off by order of the Queen. Suddenly
a wild flood of anguish surged at her heart. Could such
a thing be under the light of heaven? He so fair, so kind,
with the fire of youth in his eyes, must the rich and glad
life be torn from him in a manner so unspeakable within
a space of four short days?</p>

<p>Again she sought to speak. This time words came;
at first few and fitful, but warm from a heart all broken
with pity. “They will kill you on Tuesday?” she said.</p>

<p>The horror that ran like ice in her veins thrilled in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, mistress. The Queen has signed the warrant.
And I have done as little to deserve death as this fair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>April morning that I cannot bear to lose. But no matter.
I have had three-and-twenty years of this golden life, so
I have no ground of complaint.”</p>

<p>His courage spoke to her like a noble action.</p>

<p>“For why will they kill you?” Her heart was choking
her.</p>

<p>“They say I was concerned with Money the Papist in
the Woodgate House plot against the Queen’s life. Two
subtle knaves have sworn it, but as I desire to go to
heaven I am an entirely innocent man.”</p>

<p>She never doubted him. It was impossible to doubt
such eyes, such a voice, such a noble bearing.</p>

<p>“I know not Money nor Woodgate House, and so far
from desiring the life of the Queen I am the faithfullest
if I am also the least of her Majesty’s servants.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it must not be!” she cried in a kind of passion.</p>

<p>“There is no means to prevent it,” said the young man.
“The judges would not hear my book oath. But I think
my peace is made with God. I am already composed for
the scaffold, as I hope and believe, although it is bitterly
sore to me to leave a world such as this. Yet if I complain
I shall be unworthy of my twenty-three years of glorious
life. But tell me, mistress, of your own case. What have
you done that they should use you so cruelly? It cuts me
to the soul to see you like this.”</p>

<p>But she could give no heed now to her own pains. Her
mind was filled with horror, with a rage of pity. His
bearing was so noble, so full of an instant tenderness,
and in four brief days he must die by the ax in the pride
and splendor of his youth.</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot bear it,” she cried. “I cannot think of
you as at the point of death.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>The potent wine of youth in her own veins rendered
the thought intolerable. Such a rush of anguish came
upon her young heart as made even the long miseries of
the night seem of no account.</p>

<p>“No, no, it cannot be. I must speak to my father.”</p>

<p>“Pray, who is your father, mistress?”</p>

<p>“My father is Sir John Feversham, the Constable of
this Castle.”</p>

<p>“Alas! mistress, it is he who read to me the Queen’s
warrant. He of all men cannot help me, for it is he who
is pledged to do the Queen’s will.”</p>

<p>She who yesterday had ventured to proclaim herself
the equal of all men was now shaken with a storm of
weeping. “I will go myself to the Queen and swear to
her your innocence.”</p>

<p>“Alas! mistress, there is no time. Besides, she would
not heed you. A subtle enemy has done his work, and I
have given up all hope of life. But by God’s grace on
Tuesday I am determined to die well.”</p>

<p>Her sorrow for this brave man was a thing to see.
The proud heart was wrung with a distress that her own
cruel suffering may have rendered more poignant. Yesterday,
in the hour of her shallow arrogance, compassion
for his fate might have irked her less. But since then
she had known the dark night of the soul. Something
seemed to have broken inside her heart. Henceforward
in her plastic woman’s nature would be a subtle kinship
with all great suffering, since she herself had known it.</p>

<p>“Is there naught I may do to save you?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing, mistress. Yet I love you for your
pitiful heart, and I’ll promise you that on Tuesday I’ll
walk the firmer for it. But do not consider me, I pray
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>you. I do not think I am unhappy. I would that you
were not, sweet mistress. Tell me why you have been
used so cruelly?”</p>

<p>His voice was grave and beguiling, like one whose soul
has deep places in it. In despite of the slow agony of her
tears she had no choice but to heed it. There was in his
tender speech a quality that melted her resolve as though
it had been but a flake of snow.</p>

<p>“Tell me, sweet mistress, I pray you.”</p>

<p>How could she tell him of her frowardness? How
could she tell him of the setting up of her stubborn will
and of the grievous fashion of its breaking? How could
she tell him that in a single night she was cured forever
of the folly of holding herself other than she was?</p>

<p>But his gentle insistence was beyond her power to put
off.</p>

<p>“I have been beaten,” she said with utter humility.
“And all that has been done to me is no more than my
merit.”</p>

<p>It was the elemental woman breaking from the soul
that yesterday was so vainglorious. The young man looking
upon her from his precarious coign felt his heart leap
to her in her abasement. In the delicacy of her youth she
was the fairest thing upon which ever he had set his
eyes. It hurt him keener than his own fate that a beauty
so rare should, whatever its faults, have been chastened
so cruelly.</p>

<p>All that there was of chivalry in his tender soul went
out to her in her desolation. In his three-and-twenty
years of life he had never known love, but by God’s grace
was it given that he would not have to die without tasting
the rarest of all mortal experiences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<p>“Mistress”&mdash;his heart leaped in his throat so that he
could hardly breathe&mdash;“Give me your name, sweet mistress,
and I will promise as God is in His heaven that
on Tuesday morning when Gervase Heriot comes to die by
the ax he shall pass with your name upon his lips.”</p>

<p>Like wells of soft light her eyes shone up to him. “My
name is Anne,” she said, with a simplicity that yesterday
had not been hers.</p>

<p>“Mistress Anne, will you pray for me when I am passing?”</p>

<p>He could not hear her answer, yet he knew what it was.</p>

<p>“God keep you, sweet mistress! God keep you forever!
I will bear your name on my lips through all the
wide fields of eternity.”</p>

<p>These high-vaunting words were his last. No longer
could he keep his precarious hold on the top of the wall.
The strain on arms and knees was too much. Suddenly
the eyes so full of courage and pity were lost to her.</p>

<p>Anne was left to reel against the wall of her prison,
shaken with an anguish more terrible than any the long
night had known.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ERVASE HERIOT had entered upon the last
hours of his life. It was arranged that he should
die at eight o’clock of the April morning. He lay
in his cell during the watches of the night that was to be
his last upon earth, with every sense a-stretch. Try as
he would&mdash;and God only could know how he had fought
during these last weeks for self-mastery&mdash;he could not
subdue the insurgency of ardent blood, the intense desire
to live.</p>

<p>He was too young for death. He loved the sun, the
blue sky, the green grass, the birds in the trees, the spring
flowers, the abundant, sweet-smelling earth. He loved
his fellow-men. They amused and interested him. He
adored the beauty of women. His ears were attuned to
delicate harmonies of sound, his eyes were ravished by
feasts of color.</p>

<p>The world, that wonderful assemblance of things visible,
entranced him in its glad, mysterious majesty.
There was the soul of a poet in a frame all a-quiver
with youth. As he lay in his cell in the darkness, tossing
feverishly upon his pallet through the slow hours, he
could not bear the thought that all too soon he would see
the sun rise for the last time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<p>It drove him nearly mad to think that he must leave
it all, that his brief sojourn upon the fair and noble earth
which he loved so passionately was at an end. He was
too strong of blood for such a death. With all the force
of his will had he striven to compose himself. Many
prayers had he addressed to God that it might be given
to him to meet his fate with the high dignity that was the
due of his manhood. But as now he lay shuddering in
the darkness, do as he would he could not bring his mind
to accept the end. Times and again he pressed his wild
eyes to his pallet with a half-strangled moan of despair.</p>

<p>The fact that he was an entirely innocent man did
nothing to console him. Indeed, had he been guilty, death
had been less hard to bear. But coming to him in this
arbitrary, unjust guise, its cruel causelessness set his every
fiber in revolt.</p>

<p>Faint sounds began to creep through the night. All
too soon his quivering senses caught them. Subtle as they
were, he knew them at once for the noise of hammers
upon wood. O God! they were setting up the scaffold in
the courtyard. In spite of the strength he had won in
these last few weeks he rolled off the pallet onto his
knees and began to pray wildly. A fever shook his mind.
His new-found strength was leaving him. Death&mdash;and
such a death!&mdash;was a thing he did not know how to
meet. A grim terror took hold of him.</p>

<p>And then a thing happened to him which shook the
central forces of his being.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw the face of Anne. He saw it all wan
and swollen with tears. And as he looked he saw the
eyes grow starlike and great with their compassion. And
then he remembered his vaunt to her that he would walk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>firmly in his last hour, and that her name should be upon
his lips. Her image was hardly more than that of a mortal
daughter of men; but that which had sprung from her
own bruised spirit, which looked out of her eyes as now
he saw them in the darkness, was the only evidence he
had of the Eternal. Some immortal essence had fused
her heart as so humbly and so pitifully she had looked
up to him. Through those eyes he had seen God.</p>

<p>Such a thought had the power to offer a measure of
ease to his torments. The dreadful tumult began to
grow less. Those eyes were as stars in that gross darkness.
No longer was he afraid. A strange peace had
begun to bear him upon its wings.</p>

<p>No longer had he cause to fear the noise of the hammers.
Let the morning break. Let death come when
it would. His fainting spirit had now a manifestation to
which to cling. He would walk to the scaffold with this
noble image in his heart, and it should accompany him
forever in his wanderings through the wide fields of
eternity.</p>

<p>He crept back to his pallet, and stretched out his fever-racked
limbs to their full length. A profound peace was
enfolding him. If only death could come now!</p>

<p>Long he lay thus, and as he lay he strained his eyes to
catch the first faint light of the dawn. Would it never
arrive? All his fear now was lest this new strength
should flee as suddenly as it had been given. But no!&mdash;the
ineffable spirit that had entered into him would continue
through all eternity to bear his soul.</p>

<p>At last and quite suddenly a more instant sound began
to mingle with the distant noise of the hammers. A key
was grating in the lock of the door. Yes, his hour was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>here at last and he had not known it. With a feeling akin
to relief he sat up on his pallet.</p>

<p>He heard the door creak gently. It then came open
with so little sound as to thrill him with surprise. A faint
thread of light gleamed fitfully. But whoever was the
visitant, he was accompanied by a silence so profound
as to fill Gervase Heriot with wonder. It was not thus
that his jailers had been wont to visit him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot.”</p>

<p>The name was breathed rather than spoken. There was
a curious familiarity in the voice as it stole through the
darkness. His heart seemed to stop beating.</p>

<p>He tried to answer, but could not.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot.”</p>

<p>Beyond the faint rays of a half-shuttered lantern was
the outline of a dark form.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot.”</p>

<p>His name was being breathed in his ears. A hand had
touched him.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is you!” were the first words his tongue could
find.</p>

<p>“Do not speak,” whispered Anne Feversham. “Do
not make a sound. But if you would live follow close
without a question.”</p>

<p>He rose from his pallet unsteadily. He was utterly
bewildered and very weak from many vigils. But already
the lantern had begun to move away from him, and
it was a talisman that had the power to draw him after it.</p>

<p>Almost before he was aware of what he did he realized
that he was beyond the door of his cell.</p>

<p>“Please wait while I lock the door again,” whispered his
deliverer, “so that they may not know too soon.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p>Her deliberation, her calmness filled him with wonder.</p>

<p>Step by step they groped their way along a very narrow
corridor that smelled close and evil. The damp glistened
from the walls in the light of the lantern.</p>

<p>With infinite caution they made their way to the end
of the long passage. And as they neared its end there
arose the sound of a man snoring heavily. A jailer was
fast asleep on a low stool that had been placed just within
the outer door of the prison. He was a gross-looking
fellow, and his large legs were stretched out to the full,
barring completely the narrow way.</p>

<p>They used great caution in striding over these legs
lest they should wake their owner. When they had safely
cleared this obstacle Anne gave Gervase the lantern, and
also a poniard from a belt which she wore round her
waist. “I am going to replace the keys in his girdle,”
she whispered resolutely. “I do not think he will
wake; a powder has been shaken into his posset. But
should you see him rousing himself, plunge the dagger
into his heart. I have not the courage to do it myself.”</p>

<p>With a delicate deftness, with a cool precision that was
remarkable, Anne reattached the keys to the girdle of the
sleeping man. He did not so much as stir in his sleep.</p>

<p>“Now!” she whispered.</p>

<p>In the next moment they had crept noiselessly through
the unbarred outer door. The cool morning air rushed
upon them. They felt the delicious green turf under
their feet.</p>

<p>For all that the shrewd air played about the condemned
man’s temples, for all that the soft grass was under
him, for all that a young moon and a sky of faint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>stars was over his head, he could hardly believe he was
alive, or if alive could hardly realize he was broad
awake.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards away, round an angle of
the great building, the hammers were still mutilating the
peace of the night. As Gervase and Anne stood to listen,
not knowing what to do next and uncertain of the way
to go, since peril hemmed them in on every side, they
were greatly startled by a scrunch of feet on the gravel
quite close to them. There was a sudden drone of voices
which told them that two men were quickly approaching
the spot on which they stood. Indeed they had barely
time to put out the light of the lantern and to crouch close
under the shadow of the huge wall of the prison before
the men passed them.</p>

<p>They came so near that they almost touched Anne and
Gervase as they knelt. They heard the men open the door
through which they had just come, and as it swung back,
so close were Anne and Gervase to it that it concealed
them behind it.</p>

<p>The sudden flash of the light that one of the men
carried was very terrifying.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Nick.” The rough voice the other side of
the door was so loud in the ears of the fugitives that they
held their breaths. “Wake up, Nick.” They heard the
man grunt as he gave a vigorous shake to the turnkey,
who was still snoring tremendously. “What a devil you
are for sleeping and drinking! Master Norris the headsman
is here and would have a few words with the condemned.”</p>

<p>A perfect tornado of shakes accompanied the words,
which yielded presently to a series of kicks. Evidently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>the business of arousing the turnkey was to prove no
light one.</p>

<p>“Wake, you drunken fool. Here is Master Norris the
headsman, don’t you hear? Are you going to keep us
here all day?”</p>

<p>Hardly daring to draw breath, Anne and Gervase continued
to kneel close behind the open door. Their terror
and their peril suddenly made Anne desperate. Not daring
to speak, she plucked her companion’s sleeve; and
then putting all to the touch and keeping close under the
shadow of the wall, she started to creep away on hands
and knees from this position of imminent danger. Even
by the time they had made a distance of fifty yards in
this painful fashion, and had set a buttress of the Castle
between them and the open door, they could still hear the
indignant voice of him who had laid upon himself the task
of rousing the sleeping jailer.</p>

<p>They could breathe a little now. But their position
was still one of very great peril. The whole place seemed
to be astir. Men and lights were moving in all directions.
Voices of soldiers, workmen and servants of the Castle
were all about them. As yet there was not a single fleck
of the dawn to be seen, but already the birds had begun
their early notes. Daybreak must be very near.</p>

<p>Not for an instant must they stay in the place they
were now in. Even as they knelt close by the wall they
expected to hear the startled outcry that would announce
the escape of the condemned man.</p>

creep round to the Castle gate before the coming
dawn had time to reveal them.</p>

<p>On hands and knees they made for the open. With
no longer the shadow of the Castle walls to conceal them,
their peril was greatly increased. More than once they
stopped and lay full length on the ground, so near they
were to discovery. It seemed as if they would never be
able to get to the point they had fixed upon, which was
the precarious shelter of a few stunted shrubs growing
near to the Castle gate.</p>

<p>It was a long while before they could reach that security.
Not long perhaps in point of fact but an age in
experience. Each time they lay down on the hard cobblestones
to avoid some new danger they expected the
dread proclamation to ring in their ears. It seemed
little short of a miracle, such was their exaggeration of
events, that the escape was not known already.</p>

<p>At last they were come to the place they sought, hard
by the gate. And here it was that the Providence which
thus far had used them so well seemed now to desert
them. To their horror they realized that the east was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>already light. The only hope of getting clear had been
to slip unseen through the gate at a moment it might
chance to be open for the admission of others. But from
the first they had known that daylight would make the
risk too great to admit of any such expedient.</p>

<p>They must find some other way. Yet Anne well knew
there was no other way. The Castle was surrounded by
walls it was impossible to scale, except on the south side.
Here the parapet was low, and for a sufficient reason.
Beyond the south wall the Castle rock ended abruptly.
A terrible chasm, hundreds of feet in depth, lurked beneath.</p>

<p>They had soon decided that the gate could not avail
them now. Thus they crept away to the left in the direction
of the south wall, taking cover as they went beneath
a row of laurel-bushes. But no sooner had they reached
the wall than they saw, even in the gray twilight, that
it was certain death to climb it and hazard a descent of
the sheer precipice on the farther side. What could they
do? Every moment it was growing lighter.</p>

<p>By now Gervase had shaken off his lethargy. One who
has lain weeks in a prison and has composed himself for
death can hardly be expected to take occasion by the
hand. But the fine and keen air of the morning and the
almost miraculous chance of life that had been given
him had done much to restore his numbed faculties.
A resolve had already been born in his heart to sell
his life very dearly. In the last resort he was determined
to attempt the almost impassable face of the
cliff.</p>

<p>But there was his brave companion. She seemed to
read his mind. And reading it she summoned the courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of despair. “If there is no other way we will crawl
down the rock,” she said.</p>

<p>“It would be death, mistress.”</p>

<p>The clear eyes that were so unafraid shone like stars
through the gray light. “I do not fear death,” she said
in a low voice. “Rather death than the whip or a dungeon
underground.”</p>

<p>Dismally he realized that there was no answer to this
argument. “We will go together, mistress, wherever it
be&mdash;unless&mdash;” a deadly chill corroded the young man’s
veins&mdash;“I walk back to my prison.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said his deliverer tensely. “Anything rather
than that.”</p>

<p>Every minute it was growing lighter. They crouched
under the scanty cover of the laurel-bushes, not knowing
which way to turn or what to do. All their senses were
strung to catch the alarm they were ever expecting to
hear. But the miracle still endured; the alarm was not
yet given. Yet it was impossible that it could be much
longer delayed.</p>

<p>In despair they crept farther along the wall. They
must choose a place for the grisly descent, yet even as
they looked far down over the parapet of the wall they
hardly knew how to face such a hideous alternative.</p>

<p>“It is certain death for us both,” said Gervase. “It is
better that I returned to my prison if you are sure there
is no other way of escape.”</p>

<p>“Do you fear the rock?” The firm voice was low and
calm.</p>

<p>“For you I fear it, mistress.”</p>

<p>The starlike eyes pierced him with their light. “For
myself,” said Anne, “I fear only to be left alive.” Very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>deliberately she took the dagger from her belt. “Wherever
you go,” she said as she offered it by the hilt, “I
would have you plunge this into my heart rather than
you left me.”</p>

<p>His cold fingers trembled on the hilt of the dagger, but
even as they touched it he knew that such a deed was
far beyond his present strength. “Better the rock than
that,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, better the rock.”</p>

<p>Such a steadfast courage was like wine in his veins.
Suddenly he flung his arms about her and folded her to
him. One slow kiss was pressed upon the upturned
mouth. Certain death awaited them, and they were
young to die, but there was now no way of life. And
at least by God’s mercy they had known one high moment
which paid for all.</p>

<p>It was the man’s part first to mount the parapet. Shuddering
in every vein, he began to climb up to it. He was
not a coward, but the desire of life was running desperately
high. The girl followed close after him. Her
will was firmer than his because her imagination was less.</p>

<p>Gervase had nearly reached the coping of the low
stone wall when Anne caught at his heel and drew him
down again. “See,” she cried. “Is not that a hole in the
ground along there by that farthest bush?”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said the young man, fearing for his
resolve. “But let us not look back. If this were done
let it be done now.”</p>

<p>But sudden resolution had come upon Anne. Or was it
that resolution was failing her? At least with this new
and faint hope she was able to draw Gervase from the
wall. His will had been strung to meet the death he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>feared with all his soul, but the passion of life in his
pulses heeded her call in spite of himself.</p>

<p>There was a void, it seemed, gaping in the ground behind
the bushes but a few yards off. But Gervase could
scarce drag his body towards it as they crept close by
the wall to see what it might be. For now he felt with
a dull sense of terror that the great moment was past.
His insurgent nerves told him that not again in cold
blood would he climb to the parapet of the wall.</p>

<p>From this new errand he looked for no deliverance.
But as soon as they came near they saw that the void,
barely visible in the gray light, was a hole in the ground.
It seemed to be a kind of cavern or deep passage burrowing
far down into the very bowels of the earth. As far as
they could discern it was provided with rude steps of
stone, and the mouth of the cavern was protected by an
iron grating.</p>

<p>They did not wait upon one another’s word, but at once
and together put forth all their strength to remove this
barrier. It was so heavy that it scarcely yielded at first.
But sheer desperation armed them, so that at last they
were able to move the grating sufficiently to permit first
one of their slender bodies and then the other to squeeze
through the narrow opening into the total darkness that
lay beyond.</p>

<p>By the time they had descended three steps they could
see nothing. Absolute night yawned under their feet.
The unknown, terrible and immeasurable, began slowly to
receive them. Whither they were going they did not
know. Where the cavern led, what they would find at
the end of it or what they were likely to encounter by
the way were matters about which it was vain to speculate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>All that they knew was that for the time being they were
very precariously delivered from a more instant peril.</p>

<p>It might be perhaps that they were going to a doom
more terrible, since the unknown is ever more sinister
than the known. For aught they knew the stone steps
might carry them through that appalling darkness to the
verge of a deep well or some abyss that would shatter
them in pieces as surely as a fall from the rock itself.</p>

<p>Sheer desperation urging, however, they prepared to
descend step by step into the noisome earth. Gripping
each other’s hand tightly, they started very slowly to go
down the steps. And now it was that they had cause
to regret bitterly that the lantern which had guided
Anne to the prison had been left under the Castle wall as
being a thing that had already served its turn. At this
moment its help would have been beyond price.</p>

<p>Holding each other by the hand, their hearts violently
beating, they yielded themselves to the care of Providence.
The descent was sheer, slow and terrifying.
Bats, undisturbed for many a long year, began to hover
round them. They could not see anything; a foul
miasma hardly allowed them to breathe; each step they
took was likely to be their last, but not for a moment
did they pause in their descent.</p>

<p>They were like a pair of twin souls in the avernus.
The sense of nameless fear enfolding them was awful,
overmastering.</p>

<p>“Whither does it lead?” said Gervase at last, his whole
being now in revolt.</p>

<p>“I know not,” said his companion. “But so long as
we are like this, hand in hand together, there is surely
no need to care what lies ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Such an answer, spoken with the clear force of a noble
resolution, thrilled in his heart. The courage that was
his by nature, which the bitterness of his recent pass
had overthrown, came back to him. If death must come,
let it come to them now as each held the hand of the
other. They began to move more quickly, and now
with a sort of recklessness, far down into the chasm
that yawned darker and darker below them. Minutes
passed; step succeeded step, yet still they had not come
to the final one.</p>

<p>Would this descent never end? Would they never
again see the light? The desire to know what lay ahead
grew so intense as to be almost unendurable. This dreadful
suspense through which they were passing was
neither more nor less than torture.</p>

<p>It began to seem certain that they would find themselves
in some pit or oubliette or forgotten dungeon underground.
In that case there was some hope of concealment,
in which they might lie through the day. And if
their pursuers had not the wit to find them, when the
darkness came they might again ascend to the courtyard,
and carry out their first design of escaping through the
Castle gate.</p>

<p>At last, after at least a full hour of this torture by
hope, the steep, narrow, winding stone stairs came suddenly
to an end. It was impossible to go farther ... a
wall confronted them. It would appear that the descent
ended in a cul-de-sac. Before accepting this as a fact,
however, Gervase gave the wall a kick in order to attest
its nature. To his surprise he found it to be made of
wood.</p>

<p>That fact served to tell him that here was not the natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
end of those strange stone stairs. Something lay
beyond. Conceivably this wall was a door. But so
heavy was the darkness that it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>Gervase set to work with the dagger his companion had
given him, in order to see if he could not pierce this barrier
and gain a clue to these hidden mysteries. But the
point of the weapon was delicate and the wood was tough.
It was impossible to make any progress. At last, realizing
the attempt was vain, in a kind of despair he hurled
the whole weight of his strong frame against the door in
the faint hope that it might yield.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that when a man has grown
utterly desperate, an inspired accident shows him the way!
Gervase had looked for no result from that reckless,
despairing fling of his shoulders against that dark wall,
but to his surprise an odd creaking and cracking at once
arose. The wood was rotten with age. In the next instant,
to the unspeakable joy of Gervase and his companion,
a faint worm of light came creeping through a
rent in a door.</p>

<p>Daylight lay beyond! So cruelly had their nerves been
fretted by the slow descent into cavernous darkness, that
they could have cried out for joy at the light. Together
they hurled their strong young shoulders against the door.
Further rendings and tearings followed. Then came
an ominous crack, and there was a breach in the door
wide enough for them to pass through.</p>

<p>Their eyes were blinded by a flood of golden light. It
was broad day, and once again were they breathing the
air of morning. But where were they. They had come,
it seemed, into a small paved yard. In front of them was
a wall and a line of low buildings. In the middle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>yard was a large farmer’s wagon containing a number of
sacks of corn. To this vehicle a pair of horses was attached.</p>

<p>They crept very cautiously out of the door in the rock,
and not then until they had first made sure that the yard
was empty.</p>

<p>“This is the yard of the Castle brewhouse,” said Anne.
“There is a door yonder which opens into a lane that
runs down to the river.”</p>

<p>They ran swiftly across the yard, found the door unbarred,
and at once were free of the Castle precincts.
They were now in a long, narrow lane. It needed but a
swift glance to tell them there was not a soul in sight.
Thereupon they took to their heels and started to run
down the lane for dear life.</p>

<p>It was more than a mile in length and it led
straight to the river. It was narrow, muddy and uneven,
winding through swampy marshland over all manner of
rough ground. But in spite of the many difficulties it
presented they dashed so fiercely along the lane that it
seemed as if their hearts must burst.</p>

<p>Providence was with them still. All the way to the
river they did not meet a soul. Great as was their good
fortune, it was yet less remarkable than it appeared, since
the path they had taken was a rude cart-track rather than
a road, with a tall hedge growing on either side.</p>

<p>At last the Trent in all its morning splendor lay before
them. With sides heaving and breath sobbing, they flung
themselves beside it, burying their faces in the icy grass.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>HUDDERING with fear and gasping for breath,
they lay side by side, their convulsed faces pressed
into the grass. Such a nightmare of terrors as they
had endured had for a time overthrown them both completely.
But in their veins was youth, and very soon
the courage it gives began to renew them.</p>

<p>Yet, as thus they lay in the grass by the bank of the
river, fighting for the strength to go on, there was a grim
sense already in each of their hearts that they were no
more than a pair of birds in a snare. Not for an instant
dare they consider how long they might hope to elude
pursuit. Perhaps it might be given to them to enjoy an
hour of freedom&mdash;if freedom it could be called with a
desperate hue and cry upon their heels&mdash;but it was by
no means certain that even so much grace as this would
be vouchsafed.</p>

<p>They rose presently from the cool grass. Already their
strength had returned. It was still early morning, not
more than seven o’clock perhaps, but the day promised to
be glorious. A trembling sheen, like a curtain of finest
gossamer, was falling from the face of the sun; the mists
were receding from the fast-flowing river. Cattle were
lowing in the fields; larks were singing in the upper air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>Nature in all her color and music, in all her pomp, variety
and gladness, was spread before them. Every brake was
alive with the song of birds; from every hedge and tree
the tender green was bursting. How was it possible, amid
such a pageant of young life, for either of them to think
of death?</p>

<p>A little chilled by the grass in which they had lain, they
began again to run by the side of the river. Like a pair
of colts they shook their limbs free. For a mile or more
they ran their hardest in order to get warm, and perhaps
in order to outstrip the thought that held their souls in
thrall. On and on they ran. The sense of motion, of untrammeled
freedom in their pulses, was like a delicious
madness now. At last they stopped, feeling very hot and
breathless, and bathed their hands and faces in the river.
Then they made the discovery that they were desperately
hungry.</p>

<p>Alas! there was no means at hand of staying their
pangs. And even had food been obtainable they would
have been face to face with the fact that they had not so
much as a penny between them. The whole of their
worldly store consisted of the clothes in which they stood
and a dagger whose hilt was curiously wrought in silver.
But these were slender means enough to meet even the
most pressing of their needs. Alas! that Anne, in the
obsession of her high resolve, had forgotten the importance
of putting a purse in her pocket.</p>

<p>It was a bitter discovery. Slowly and very surely the
pangs of their hunger were mounting, so that all too soon
their spirits fell. Then they sat on the grass and rested
awhile and dabbled their wrists in the cool water of the
fast-flowing river. Thus they gained new strength and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>were put in better heart. And as they now continued
their strange journey at a drooping pace, they walked
hand in hand with a kind of tragic tenderness.</p>

<p>In a little while, however, Providence again declared
itself to them.</p>

<p>A sudden turn of the riverside path revealed a woman
sitting under a hedge milking a cow. Hand in hand, like
a pair of children, they approached her and humbly craved
one drink apiece from her pail.</p>

<p>The woman was old and ill-seeming, with a very hard
face, and there was nothing about her to suggest that it
was her nature to be generous. But the strange request
was made very politely. It was preferred in a manner
not unworthy of persons of condition, but in the shrewd
eyes of Mistress Poll Plackett their appearance had a
grave lack of anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The man was without a hat, his long fair hair was lank
and undressed, his clothes, though of a good sort, were
covered with mud, and his face might have had considerable
beauty had it been less wild, less pitifully haggard.
As for his companion, good Mistress Plackett was completely
at a loss to say who and what she might be. In
the first place it was hard to determine her sex, let alone
her degree. The shape was all slenderness, all long-flanked
delicacy; a profusion of charming curls escaped
in clusters from under her velvet cap; the face, full of a
rare and vivid beauty, was lit by two eyes that were like
twin stars of gray light. Yet she too was covered with
mud and she bore a look of wild distress. And far worse
even than this, to Mistress Plackett’s horror the nether
limbs were clad in a pair of leather breeches.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this unlucky garment their good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>looks and good manners might have melted the heart of a
prudent housewife and fearless Christian. But such
a strange style of dress was a sore tax upon her forbearance.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say, and that’s the truth,”
said Mistress Plackett very doubtfully indeed. “I
don’t like the looks o’ ye. Can ye pay for a little drink
apiece?”</p>

<p>“By my faith no,” said Gervase, with perfect honesty.
“We cannot do that, good dame. But give us even a very
little draught of your delicious milk and we will bless the
day that you were born.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt ye will,” said Mistress Plackett sourly,
“if ye get a drink for nix.”</p>

<p>Further scrutiny followed hard upon this unblushing
confession of absence of wherewithal. Moreover it
seemed to confirm Mistress Plackett’s unfavorable
opinion.</p>

<p>“Do you see any green in this eye, young man?” said
she. “And do you suppose that Poll Plackett has passed
three-score and five winters in a hard world, and the same
amount o’ summers to match ’em, not to have better
wisdom than to give away milk warm from the cow to
a gallus pair o’ strolling Egyptians?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be hard-hearted, mother, I pray you,” said
the young man in his beguiling speech. “If only you
knew how hungry we are! Let us drink only a very
little of your delicious milk, and God will reward
you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, young man,” said Mistress Plackett, “and
maybe He will reward me doubly for the little ye take
not. However, here is the pail. Have a little drink, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>Egyptian, for I am bound to say you have a very good-looking
face.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” said Gervase, eagerly seizing the
milk-pail. “But first may I offer it to&mdash;to my friend?”</p>

<p>“No, you may not,” said Mistress Plackett roundly.</p>

<p>“But why may I not, good mother? We will take but
a very little apiece.”</p>

<p>But Mistress Plackett shook her head sternly. “Be
your friend a man or a woman?” she said.</p>

<p>“Can you not see that she is a young gentlewoman?”</p>

<p>“Od burn me if I can!” said Mistress Poll. “A young
woman she may be, but gentle she is not, to appear out
of her sex. I will not have my honest pail go near such
a shameless thing. Let her keep off, else you shall go
wanting yourself.”</p>

<p>“But, good mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let the young doxey keep off, I say. She shall not
have a drop as I am a virtuous woman. And if I did but
know where to find Master Tippet the thirdborough, she
should be burned in the hand and whipped out o’ the
county o’ Derby.”</p>

<p>So shocked was Mistress Poll Plackett when she discovered
the sex of the second Egyptian, that the first, for
all his beguiling speech, was like to go hungry. Gervase
and Anne were desperately keen-set, and they very well
knew that it was within their power to take the milk-pail
from the custody of this good lady, and to soften her
protests by applying the milking stool to her head. But
fierce as their hunger was, they yet hesitated to take such
extreme measures. Still it was driving them so hard as
sorely to try their forbearance.</p>

<p>“The shameless hussy shall not touch a drop,” said Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Poll. “But you seem a proper and decent and fair-spoken
youth, and ye shall sup a modest bellyful.”</p>

<p>“Not a drop will I touch until my sister has drunk,”
said Gervase.</p>

<p>“Ye called her friend just now,” said Mistress Plackett
grimly.</p>

<p>“Sister and friend,” said the young man, with a profound
air. “He who finds a friend in a sister has a
sister for a friend.”</p>

<p>Gervase spoke with much gravity, as if this gem of
philosophy was worthy of the deepest consideration. He
had already grasped the truth that there are occasions in
life when it matters little what is said so long as it be well
said. And in that age he would have been a poor-witted
fellow who having been bred as a scholar could not readily
assume the garb of wisdom.</p>

<p>Yet after all it may have been less Gervase Heriot’s
whimsical readiness that prevailed with the good wife
than his charming voice, his tall, fine person and his
gracious, manly air. When all was said this was no
Egyptian. None of the tribe of lawless wanderers could
have shown such a delicacy of manners when hunger
drove him hard.</p>

<p>“Ye can both drink your fill,” said Mistress Poll
Plackett.</p>

<p>They needed no second invitation. Anne drank first
of the warm, delicious draught, that might have been
ambrosia straight from heaven. Then drank Gervase.</p>

<p>“Good mother,” he said as he gave back the pail, “two
wayfardingers will remember you in their prayers this
night. And our prayers, alas! must be your only guerdon.
But from our hearts we thank you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p>Mistress Poll shook her head. “Let it be so,” she said
gruffly. “Although you can’t cut ice with thank you,
still I don’t begrudge the milk, young man. But my advice
to you is this: when you come to a bush give your
young doxey a sound beating, that she may learn not
to ape her betters in such a shameless livery.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY gave good-day to Mistress Poll and passed
on their way wonderfully refreshed in body and
spirit. Still they kept by the river. The sun was
now shining clear out of a pure and limpid heaven. Above
and all about the birds were singing. They could almost
hear the sap running in the trees; yellow daffodils shone
in the grass; the little green buds were bursting from
brake and thicket. By now a wild sense of freedom was
in their veins and they had a great delight in the company
of each other. Yet behind all things&mdash;the glamour of
the earth, the golden sky, the grave majesty of nature&mdash;lay
a dark, terrifying cloud.</p>

<p>Not for a moment could they forget that their lives
hung by a thread. They were ever looking back to see if
their pursuers were yet in sight. They raked each bush
they came near to see if it held an enemy. At every bend
in the river they made ready to be sprung upon.</p>

<p>And, as they were soon to learn, there was only too
much reason for these fears. It happened that they had
made another two miles or so when they came to a tall
hedgerow running at right angles to the river. And
Gervase, looking along it in his constant vigilance, saw
to his dismay a small party of mounted men, wearing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>conspicuous scarlet livery of Sir John Feversham. They
were no more than fifty yards away, and were coming
slowly down the hedgerow on the other side, beating the
bushes as they came and examining them closely.</p>

<p>Providence for the moment was with Gervase and
Anne. The height of the hedge and an abrupt bend of
the river served to hide them from view. Instantly they
took cover by flinging themselves full length in the grass
in which they stood. There was nothing else to be done;
their pursuers were so near that flight was impossible.</p>

<p>All that remained for them was the hope that they had
not been seen as yet, and that their pursuers would not
come over to their place of concealment. But as thus they
lay close in dire suspense, they were not aware of a more
instant danger. Within a few yards of them, on their
own side of the hedge, a man with a dog was approaching.</p>

<p>As yet the man had not seen them, but alas! the dog
had already discovered them. It ran straight to where
they lay concealed in the grass, and to their horror began
to fondle Anne and lick her face. In the next moment a
man on a horse was bending over them.</p>

<p>Thrusting the dog away from her, Anne looked up and
saw the man, and as she did so her heart died within her.
It was John Markham the falconer. His eyes were fixed
upon the prostrate form of Gervase. In the very fascination
of terror she watched his hand stray to the hilt of his
dagger.</p>

<p>Both the fugitives lay in the grass staring up helplessly
into the grim eyes of the falconer. They could neither
move, speak nor act. A chill of horror was upon their
souls. But the dog, Anne’s old friend and companion,
was overjoyed and continued to lick and fondle her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Of a sudden John Markham’s hand forsook the hilt of
his dagger. And in the same instant his face changed
from the tawny bloom of health to a hue far otherwise.
His rather slow brain had realized who it was that lay by
the side of the escaped prisoner.</p>

<p>The falconer grew white as death. He was the devoted
servant of a good and honored master. But beyond all
things he was the slave of his young mistress. All was
mad turmoil at the Castle. As yet none had had thought
to spare for Mistress Anne. Her absence had not been
noted, perhaps not even by the Constable himself. All
that was known was that the condemned man had made
his way out of his prison, in a manner bordering upon
the miraculous, within some two hours of the time fixed
for his execution.</p>

<p>Here was the explanation of the mystery! In a moment
of harrowing bitterness of soul John Markham read
the terrible truth.</p>

<p>“Oh my mistress!” was wrung from his lips.</p>

<p>John Markham’s was a slow brain, but now his high
devotion lent it swiftness and subtlety. In that instant
he had learned all. She whom he had adored with a
passionate fidelity had given everything that was hers to
one whom by all the terms of his honorable service he was
pledged to retake.</p>

<p>“Oh my mistress!” A tear sparkled upon the falconer’s
cheek.</p>

<p>The fugitives lying in the grass made no reply. And
in his anguish of mind the falconer seemed as helpless as
they. In the next moment came a shout from the other
side of the hedge.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, Markham, what have you there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The words broke the spell for the man who loved his
young mistress devotedly. “The dog seems to have found
a rabbit,” was his answer.</p>

<p>“Naught better than that!” came in tones of disappointment.
“We were hoping he had found something else.”</p>

<p>The falconer called off the dog, and then immediately
rode away to join his companions.</p>

<p>Gervase and Anne lay in the grass until the Constable’s
men were out of sight. For the moment the danger was
past. But they were possessed by fear they could not
overcome. More and more they marveled at the singular
Providence that held them in its care. Gervase had no
knowledge of the falconer; thus all that had happened
was to him a mystery. With Anne it was otherwise.
Yet over and above a feeling of gratitude for the man’s
fidelity was the sting of remorse and a sharp pang of
regret for the glad, glorious and free life of yesterday.</p>

<p>Less than a week had gone since she had last ridden in
the fields with the falconer, mounted on her blood horse
Cytherea, with her pied merlin upon her fist. Since then
the whole of life had changed. There had come the terrible
breaking of the imperious will, which after all was
not more than the will of a woman. And hard upon that,
and doubtless because of it, there had come this wild and
complete surrender to the impulse of pity which had
banished her completely and forever from the world in
which she had dwelt.</p>

<p>Long after John Markham and his companions had
passed out of sight she lay in the grass sobbing hysterically.
Such a wild storm of tears came upon her as
seemed to shake the slender form in pieces. And Gervase
was powerless to comfort her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>After a time her pitiful distress abated, and then they
found the courage to go on. For some miles they followed
the river, yet with a redoubled wariness. Their
adventure had shaken them terribly. They did not know
which way to go or what to do. They wandered aimlessly,
but with every sense a-stretch and with terror
gnawing at their hearts. Soon they were hungry again,
yet they had not so much as a penny with which to buy
food. Their spirits drooped. The April sun was still
shining out of a clear sky, the birds were still singing
gaily from every bush, the carpet of spring flowers was
still spread vividly before them, but the world was now
a different place.</p>

<p>At noon they saw a village in the distance away to the
right. It was perilous to enter it, but hunger drove them
hard. Thus they turned their steps towards it in the hope
that by some good chance they might obtain a little food.</p>

<p>The village proved to be a rather large one. And in
the middle of the main street was the shop of a baker.
They felt they were taking their lives in their hands by
showing themselves in a public place, since they had had
such clear evidence that the hue and cry was upon their
heels, but the pangs of hunger rendered them desperate.</p>

<p>Happily the baker seemed to dwell in complete ignorance
of the recent happenings at Nottingham Castle,
which to be sure was fifteen miles away. But in another
respect the fugitives were less fortunate. The man of
flour proved to be a very shrewd and surly fellow.</p>

<p>He would only part with one of his loaves, even a stale
one, on the express condition that it was paid for in current
coin of the realm. Would he accept a dagger with
a hilt wrought curiously in silver in exchange for twenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>pieces of that precious metal? No, he would not. Would
he for ten? No, he would not. He had no use for a
dagger, silver-hilted or otherwise. The only thing he
had a use for was an honest true penny when it came
to a matter of a quartern loaf.</p>

<p>All Gervase’s persuasiveness could do nothing with
this sturdy Saxon. One of his quartern loaves was worth
a penny, as had been those of his father before him; a
penny was its price in the open market, and he would
defy the devil himself to get one for less. In such circumstances
there was nothing for Anne and Gervase to
do but to return bitterly hungry to the village street.</p>

<p>They feared to show themselves in it, but alas; the spur
of hunger is a most instant thing. Sad indeed and footsore
already with their wandering, they walked through
the village. Both were tired and thirsty and also faint for
lack of food. They kept close under the houses, expecting
at any moment to be sprung upon by the men in the
scarlet livery.</p>

<p>In the middle of the road, coming slowly towards them,
was a ragged nut-brown vagabond playing a flageolet for
pence. He was very far from being a skilful performer.
Indeed his tunes upon his cracked instrument were as
ragged as himself. But apparently they did not lack the
approval of the public. For while Gervase and Anne
stood looking wistfully at this draggle-tail, a well-dressed
man riding a good horse tossed the fellow a coin as he
passed.</p>

<p>Adversity is a great thing for the mind. Gervase at
once took the idea that he himself could perform quite as
villainously if only he could come by an instrument. If
only he might barter the silver-hilted dagger for a flageolet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
even of the most lamentable kind, it might be possible
in the present condition of the public taste to keep body
and soul together.</p>

<p>He gave the idea to Anne, who approved it heartily,
always assuming that he had some little skill upon the
instrument.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Gervase. “I learned to play on the
flageolet when I was at Paris. ’Tis the only thing I
learned there; at least it is the only thing I learned there
that is likely to serve us now.”</p>

<p>But how were they to come by such a thing? That
was a problem indeed. Under the spur of their necessity
they went after the ragged fellow and were fain to interrupt
him in the midst of his discoursing of the infamous
melody of “Jumping Joan.”</p>

<p>He did not thank them for their interruption.</p>

<p>“Barter my pipe for a silver-hilted dagger, quotha?
I would not barter my pipe for all the pearls in the head
o’ the Virgin Queen. Stand out o’ my light and let me
proceed.”</p>

<p>He was a rude fellow and a fierce one, and he was like
to stride over them in his haste to get clear of the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Barter my pipe!” they could hear him mutter
as he passed down the road. It was as though he
had been asked to barter his religion. He poured out
a string of curses and then returned to his villainous
melody.</p>

<p>Feeling almost desperate, they dragged themselves
along the street until they came to a door with a bush
hanging over it which showed it was the village ale-house.
Here on a bench outside the door they flung themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>down. The seat was hard and narrow, yet infinitely delicious
to their weariness.</p>

<p>Here they sat until the landlord came to them. They
marked his appearance with great trepidation as to what
manner of a man he was. Like that of the baker, his
aspect was large and stubborn but not genial.</p>

<p>“I give you good morrow, Master Innkeeper,” said
Gervase in his frank and pleasant fashion.</p>

<p>“Good morrow to you, young man,” said the innkeeper
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Do you care to buy a dagger with a hilt wrought
curiously in silver?”</p>

<p>“That I do not,” said the innkeeper; “I would not care
to buy anything except a halter for my wife.”</p>

<p>“What will it profit your wife,” asked Gervase, “if
you provide her with a halter? You are not going to
hang her, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Hang her! God bless me, no! It is simply that to-morrow
I am going to lead her in her shift with a halter
round her neck as far as Derby market-place and sell her
to the highest bidder. Happen, young man, you don’t
want a wife yourself?”</p>

<p>“What is the price you ask for her?”</p>

<p>“A gold angel will buy her, and she’s worth double the
money.”</p>

<p>“But why do you part with her? Has she a fault in
her temper, or is it that she is not as virtuously given as
she might be?”</p>

<p>“No, her temper is excellent; and as for her virtue,
the vicar of the parish will answer for that.”</p>

<p>“Then in that case,” said Gervase, “a gold angel seems
little enough to pay for her.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, she’s a great bargain,” said the innkeeper; “you
can make your mind easy, young man, on that score.”</p>

<p>“One might take her for a month on trial, I suppose?”
said Gervase.</p>

<p>“No,” said the landlord decisively; “if you decide to
have her you must pay your gold angel and take her off
my hands at once. But as I say, you will have a bargain.
Her virtue and her temper are excellent, and if you remind
her what a rope’s end feels like at every new moon
I’ll warrant that you’ll have no trouble with her at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope she can cook a meal,” said Gervase. “It
is an excellent thing in a woman if she is able to cook
a meal.”</p>

<p>“I’ll answer for her cooking, young man. You couldn’t
find a better hand at that sort of thing if you tried all
over the county o’ Derby.”</p>

<p>“Skilled in making bread?”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, yes!”</p>

<p>“And in making cheese, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Ask Master Radlett the bailiff what he thinks of her
cream cheeses.”</p>

<p>“Can she brew ale?”</p>

<p>“Aye, and cider too and also perry.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s a paragon, I’m bound to admit.”</p>

<p>“Aye, she’s a nonesuch, there’s not the least doubt about
that,” said the innkeeper. “Her bread and her cider are
things to remember.”</p>

<p>“Things to dream upon, in fact?”</p>

<p>“Yes, young man; and if you doubt me you had better
try them for yourself.”</p>

<p>Now it was here that Gervase affected a lordly indifference,
a lofty disdain. “Well, Master Innkeeper, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>don’t mind very much if I do,” he said, and his air was
almost one of condescension.</p>

<p>“You shall do so young man,” said the innkeeper
proudly.</p>

<p>And in an exceedingly loud voice he addressed some
unseen presence within the precincts of the inn kitchen.
“Marian, bring out at once one of your newest and largest
loaves for a young gentleman in a tarnished doublet of
black velvet.”</p>

<p>“You have forgotten the cider,” said Gervase, with an
air of profound indifference. “A large pot would be the
best, I think.”</p>

<p>“Also a full pint pot o’ your last year’s cider, Marian.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps a little of the cream cheese would not be
amiss in the circumstances. It is wise as a rule to make
quite sure in a matter of this kind.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the innkeeper heartily. “There is
nothing betwixt here and Derby that can hold a candle
to her cream cheese. Bring out a ripe cream cheese,
Marian.”</p>

<p>Anne began to tremble with excitement at the mere
mention of these viands, but Gervase sat as cool and collected
as any man could have done in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Presently a crone about seventy years of age brought
forth a loaf of bread, a cheese and a jug of cider. She
laid them on the bench by the side of Gervase.</p>

<p>With much deliberation the young man broke the bread
in half and divided the cheese into two portions with his
dagger. He handed one share to his companion solemnly.
“I ought to tell you, Master Innkeeper,” Gervase explained,
“that my sister here is about as good a judge
of food as there is to be found in the Midland Counties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Tell me what you think of the cheese, my dear Philomela?”</p>

<p>It was as much as ever Anne could do not to appear
ravenous. “I think the cheese is splendid,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ha! I knew it would be so!” said the landlord. “And
what do you think o’ the bread and the cider, you pretty
young doxey?”</p>

<p>“I have never tasted anything like them,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“Ha! I knew it would be so!” said the landlord, with
an air of pride that was wonderful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y reason of this odd adventure Anne and Gervase
were in good heart all the afternoon. Providence
had surely taken them in its care. Food was not
plenty, their feet were getting very sore, their enemies
might be upon them at the next turn in the road, they
knew not where that night to lay their heads; but trudging
ever side by side in the company of each other they
had the spirit of youth to bear them on.</p>

<p>Again they took to the winding river-bank. It was
kindlier traveling that way. The springing green turf
was far easier than the hard stones of the road. Also
the dust was less and there were fewer people to
avoid.</p>

<p>Towards evening poor Anne began to limp rather
sorely. But not a word of complaint passed those resolute
lips. Gervase too was in sad case. Full many a weary
mile had they made since their wild setting forth in the
dawn of the April morning.</p>

<p>Several times in the late afternoon they were obliged to
sit by the river and seek some little ease by taking off
their shoes and stockings and by bathing their aching
feet in the cool water. But their courage was wonderfully
high, for youth was with them, and also Providence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>and also a something rare and strange which each had
kindled in the other’s heart.</p>

<p>The mists of evening began to steal down the river.
As the fugitives sat on a green bank by the side of the
water, their faces aglow with the sunset, nature spoke to
them with a new, a fuller, an intenser meaning. Bird and
beast, herb and tree were thrilling with life. And yet as
Gervase and Anne sat close together they felt a sense of
their tragic destiny overtaking them. The life of one,
perhaps of both, was forfeit. The dark shadow was ever
in their minds. All thought of the morrow must be put
away.</p>

<p>The sun had left them now. Out of the dark valley,
a little sinister with its close-grown gloom of trees,
through which the reaches of the river wound, a faint
wind came stealing. Very softly it caressed the face of
the water, making an effect of music, eerie, solemn, yet
enchanting.</p>

<p>Gervase knitted his brave companion to his heart. The
flood-tide of youth was surging in his veins. The sudden
sense of possession, of high comradeship gave him
one of those rare moments to which the mind goes back
when it comes to ask whether life has been worth all
that has been paid for it in blood and tears. To this
slender thing, so true, so resolute, he owed the life which
for the moment was raised to this perilous height of
ecstasy. In his arms he held this great gift of God to
man; but a voice spoke to the chivalrous heart of him that
he must hold it reverently.</p>

<p>One kiss on the lips he yielded and no more. He would
have pressed a thousand there, but let him not forget the
awful tragedy of their present hour. No consummation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>their love could ever know on earth. He fixed an iron
control upon his will. And yet.... Whatever held the
earthly morrow, were they not twin souls pledged to
roam the starry spaces of eternity together? In the surge
of his passion he tore himself suddenly from the warm
embrace and rose wildly from the green bank of earth.</p>

<p>The darkness came, and more weary miles they trudged,
her cold hand clasped in his still colder one. The night
fell very chill and without a single star. Soon they left
the river and struck inland, through hedges and over
swampy marshland, in the hope of finding a lodging for
the night more hospitable than the open country.</p>

<p>Of food there was little prospect. But under Providence,
which during the whole of that long and terrible
day had been so kind to them, they might hope to find
shelter in a cow-hovel, or a shepherd’s hut, or at the worst
a dry ditch. And at last, when they had grown so faint
with hunger and fatigue that they knew not how they
could go another mile, Providence was moved again to
pity them.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came upon the dark bulk of a line of
farm-buildings just ahead of them. A little groping
brought them to a gate which led to a stackyard. By
now the moon was showing, and with the aid of her fitful
light they were able to find a stable. Here was a ladder
which led to a hay-loft; and in spite of the darkness they
made their way into it, whereupon to their unspeakable
joy they found bundles of clean hay upon which they
could lie warm and snug until daybreak.</p>

<p>In utter weariness they burrowed under the hay like
moles, and very soon their cares were laid aside in as
sound a sleep as they had ever known. When they awoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>daylight was stealing in through the chinks in the roof.
It was still very early, to judge by the absence of sounds
from below.</p>

<p>The abundance of the hay had kept them wonderfully
warm during the night, and now they shook their limbs
free of it with a feeling of refreshment and gratitude.
But scarcely had they begun to move when they felt a
mighty need of food. Whatever befell, at all costs must
they seek some.</p>

<p>They came down from the loft and crossed the yard,
first making sure, however, that there was no one about.
The morning was cold and misty. Not far off was a
byre, and a number of cows were in it ready for milking.</p>

<p>Hunger was pressing them too hard to be put off with
a scruple. Eagerly they searched all about the farmyard
for a pail, and at last were able to find one in the
stable out of which they had come. It was not very clean,
but the attentions of the farmyard pump soon made it
fit for use.</p>

<p>However, when it came to a matter of milking the
cows they discovered but little skill at first. Gervase
tried his hand with very poor results. Anne then took
a turn, and at last the pail began to fill.</p>

<p>She it was who drank first this nectar of the gods.
Then followed Gervase; then followed Anne again, and
then again Gervase. Never in their lives had they had
so rare a breakfast. But so completely had they been
absorbed in their task that they had paid no heed to the
passing of the time, or to that which was going on around
them. The enjoyment of this illicit repast had taken more
than an hour, and the farmyard was now astir.</p>

<p>Of this fact they were soon made aware. Indeed their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>meal was scarce at an end when a man’s shadow was
thrown across the doorway of the cowhouse, and there
was the farmer standing looking at them.</p>

<p>He was a very powerful man, broad and heavy, and
dressed in a suit of russet leather. His hands were tucked
in his jerkin and his chin was sunk upon his breast as
if he were wrapped in profound thought. The look upon
his face was not so much of anger as of amazement. “I
trust ye have had your fill?” he said at last, speaking
in a slow, deep voice.</p>

<p>“That we have,” said Gervase heartily.</p>

<p>All the same he felt a kind of shame for having debauched
himself so freely upon another’s property. Yet
it would be idle to deny that a sense of well-being was
uppermost in his mind at that moment. When all was
said, this feeling outweighed any that he might have had
of moral turpitude.</p>

<p>“Well, then, having had your fill,” said the farmer,
speaking as one who chooses his words, “you will not object
perhaps to make payment?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot do, I am sorry to say,” said Gervase.</p>

<p>“It is just as I thought,” growled the farmer.</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon,” said Gervase, “for taking your
milk, but we have no money to pay for any food and we
are starving.”</p>

<p>The face of the farmer was very ugly now. “Starving,
are ye? Well, my lad, ye shall both come with me to the
constable.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I cannot oblige you in that,” said Gervase.
“I own I have done you a wrong, but not such a
wrong as to allow the law to mend it.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, you shall not go without payment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>some kind,” said the farmer, “and you can lay to that.
Either step wi’ me to the constable, or if you’d rather
have it that way, come out into the yard and have the
properest thrashing you’ve had in all your born days.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps that is not unfair&mdash;if you can give it
me.” Gervase spoke with the modest readiness of a
man of mettle.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give it you right enough,” said the farmer,
“and you can lay to that.”</p>

<p>Certainly he was a most formidable-looking fellow, and
he spoke with a truculence sufficient to strike terror into
all save the very stout of heart. But Gervase, having
slept soundly and breakfasted well, was not inclined to
quail. He stepped briskly into the yard at the farmer’s
behest. But there a rude shock awaited him.</p>

<p>“Diggory,” called the farmer to one of his hands at
work in the yard, “you just fetch my horsewhip along.
Ask mistress to give it thee. Now then, step lively.”</p>

<p>Gervase, however, proceeded to show cause why Diggory
should not step lively. “Oh no, you don’t, Master
Giles,” he said to the farmer with a laugh. “Pray don’t
think I am going to take it that way.”</p>

<p>“Then what way are you going to take it, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Man to man with the bare knuckles if I take it at
all.”</p>

<p>“Then by God you shall!” The farmer suddenly flung
off his coat. “But you don’t know what you are out for,
young fellow. A bit o’ whipcord will come a lot kinder
to you than these ten commandments o’ mine.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll risk that,” said Gervase modestly.</p>

<p>The farmer rolled up his sleeves, disclosing a pair of
mighty arms. “I’m the man,” he said, “who pretty nigh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>killed Job Nettle in the fight at Lichfield twenty years
ago. They talk about it to this day. And I reckon, young
fellow, I’ll pretty nigh kill you. There was never none
as could stand against Gideon Partlet as ever I heard
tell of. Did you, Diggory, ever hear o’ such?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Diggory, “naw, I niver.”</p>

<p>And the eyes of Diggory began to start in anticipation.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ERTAINLY the farmer had the look of a bruiser.
Moreover he had a robust confidence in his own
powers, and this was expressed by the grin of
satisfaction upon his face. A number of the farm hands
soon came up, attracted by the never-failing charms of
a bout of fisticuffs.</p>

<p>Gervase followed the example of his adversary by
discarding his doublet and rolling up his shirt-sleeves.
He was far slighter of build and cast in a mold altogether
more delicate than the farmer. Still he was a
very likely looking fellow.</p>

<p>As became a gentleman of his time, his education had
been liberal. Martial and manly exercises had played
their part in it. Even in such a simple affair as a set-to
with fists he was not without instruction from professors
of the craft. Therefore he had a modest hope that he
would be able to take care of himself, even if his foe
was a man of greater power and experience.</p>

<p>Gervase gave Anne his doublet to hold. She, alas!
was terribly distressed when she saw what was going to
happen. But there was no help for it. If Gervase did
not fight the farmer he must submit to the hands of the
law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Her natural woman’s instinct was to run away and
hide while the battle was fought. But her staunchness
forbade such a course. She mustered all her resolution
in order to remain where she was. Gervase might have
sore need of her help before he was through with a
business so grievous.</p>

<p>Although the blows turned her sick, she forced herself
to stand by the wall of the cowhouse and with
wildly beating heart watched the progress of the fight.
The might of the farmer’s arms was terrific. Happily
he was a man past fifty; he carried far more of flesh
than when he was in his prime as a fighter; and thus
was Gervase given an opportunity to ward or avoid
the worst of his blows. Well it was for him that he was
able to do this, for in his prime, which was twenty-five
years ago, Gideon Partlet had been a famous fighter.
Even now much of the old skill remained; but the muscles
were not so supple and he could not get about as
craftily as of yore.</p>

<p>All the same the farmer brought such a zest to his
fighting, he delivered such a rain of blows, and there
was such a power behind them, that had not Gervase
been uncommonly quick with his hands and feet it must
have gone hard with him.</p>

<p>The farmer’s great fists would have dealt out terrible
punishment had the milk-stealer been unable to parry
them. Even as it was, and in spite of all that he could
summon of youth, activity and skill, Gervase did not
get off scot free. To the huge delight of the farm
hands who were shouting loud encouragement to their
master, the milk-stealer received one blow on the side
of the jaw that shook him terribly, while another caught
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>the young man on the nose and drew his blood. But this
was slight punishment compared with what might have
been, for had Gervase been wholly without experience
he had paid heavy toll for his felony.</p>

<p>Now Gervase was enough of a man to accept and perhaps
even to desire punishment for his offence. He could
not help feeling that Master Gideon Partlet had received
a deep wrong at his hands, so that he felt at first no
very great animosity toward the farmer. But if the
truth must be told, the crack on the jaw shook considerably
this chivalrous desire to make payment in kind for
his felony; the starting of the blood rendered it in
imminent danger; and when presently he was so hard
pressed that his right eye was like to be closed, the
noble sense of equity of which all men do well to be
jealous, was thrown to the wind.</p>

<p>It seemed then to grow clear to the mind of Gervase
that Master Gideon Partlet somehow lacked a sense of
proportion. The buffets on jaw and nose were in his
opinion quite as much as the milk was worth. The
assault on the right eye was usury. But the farmer did
not share this view. Once blooded, he fought more furiously
than ever. Moreover he accompanied each blow
with a savage grunt and did all he knew to pin the
younger and lighter man against the wall of the byre.</p>

<p>The distress of poor Anne was dreadful. Brave as
she was, after a few moments she could endure the sight
no more. Shuddering, she hid her eyes in the doublet
of her champion.</p>

<p>Would the fight never cease? She began to fear that
the farmer would kill Gervase. No longer dare she
look at the cruel spectacle, but the ever-recurring sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>of the blows chilled and sickened her. At last there
came a loud cry from the onlookers, and then the dread
sounds ceased. When she ventured to look she made
the discovery that a very strange thing had happened.</p>

<p>The farmer was prone on his back in the mire of his
own stackyard. He lay motionless; and Gervase and
one of the hands were bending over him and were in
the act of raising him up.</p>

<p>“Oh, is he dead?” gasped Anne.</p>

<p>“Not he,” said Gervase cheerfully. He besought her
to bring a little water from the pump in the milk-pail.</p>

<p>By the time this had been brought the farmer was
sitting up rather ruefully in the straw of the yard. Gervase
supported him with a shoulder; but soon finding
that Gideon Partlet was little the worse for the blow
on the point of the jaw that had leveled him to mother
earth, the young man proceeded to clear the blood from
his own face by dipping it in the bucket.</p>

<p>The farmer watched the process with an air of grim
approval. “Here’s my hand, young man,” he said when
Gervase’s countenance had been put in some sort of
order. “You are a lad of mettle and a pretty fighter.
By God, young fellow, I didn’t think ye kept such a clip
as that in your shirt.”</p>

<p>The farmer seemed to think it was the finest jest in
the world that one so wise and crafty as himself should
have been careless enough to lay himself open to such
a blow. And, as became one who had enjoyed many
triumphs in his youth, he was too good a fellow not
to be able to laugh at his own expense. “Tell me, young
man, where did ye learn that buffet? A thing like that
don’t come by nature.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>
<p>“I had it of Christopher Tattersall, the Yorkshire
champion,” said Gervase modestly.</p>

<p>“Did ye so?” said the farmer, with a kind of enthusiasm.
“Well, it’s the prettiest buffet I’ve smelt this
thirty year.”</p>

<p>“I would not have used it had you not forced me to,”
said Gervase.</p>

<p>“And if I’d known you were keeping it in your sleeve
I’d not have held ye so light, young fellow, and you can
lay to that.”</p>

<p>The farmer spoke with a kind of grim admiration, as
became an old warrior who had dealt many a shrewd
knock in his time. He bore no malice, either for the
rape of his milk or for the blow to his pride. Besides,
much was to be forgiven a lad of the true mettle.</p>

<p>“If you and your young doxey will step as far as the
kitchen,” said he, “perhaps the good wife can find ye a
bite o’ breakfast apiece.”</p>

<p>In spite of the quantity of the new milk they had consumed
Gervase and Anne needed no second invitation.</p>

<p>The good wife, to be sure, viewed them at first with
little in the way of favor. Certainly neither was very
reputable to look upon. Fragments of straw and flakes
of dried mud were clinging to their clothes, and their
faces had not met soap and water for many hours. Also
the face of Gervase was sadly swollen and discolored.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of the good wife’s misgivings she gave
them a delicious breakfast of collops, hot cakes and ale.
Never in their lives had they had such a repast. And
the farmer, for all that they had stolen his milk, was fain
to heap up their platters with the large generosity of one
who has been a first-rate fighter in his youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“I know not who you be, young fellow,” said he.
“You have an air of quality, although you may be none
the less a cutthroat for that. Perhaps you are Tat
Barcey, the gentleman prig. Still, I care not who you
are, but by God’s life you are a mighty pretty fighter.
Wife, give the young rogue another slice o’ the cake
and give some more swipes to the young doxey. Let
it never be said that Gideon Partlet knows not how to
honor a stout and crafty fighter.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that an hour hence they went forth furnished
royally. High of heart, they took the road again.
A night’s rest and a square meal are wonder-working
things. For a time they were no longer the hunted
fugitives of the previous day. Girt by the spirit of youth
and braced by good cheer, they struck across the country
into the Derbyshire woods. Here their path was
spread with primroses and all manner of spring delights.
The bursting buds caressed their faces, the odor of wild
flowers was in their nostrils, a thousand golden-throated
voices filled their ears.</p>

<p>In the high-hearted freedom of the moment they forgot
their tragic peril. This was life in its rapture, life
in its fulness. Soon Gervase began to sing.</p>

<p>The green aisles re-echoed his voice. Presently they
rested on a moss-grown bank with the great river flowing
far beneath them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>They looked in the ardent eyes of one another utterly
heedless of what was to come. In this joyous morning
of spring they were determined to forget the horror
that held them in thrall. Let the morrow bring what
it might, in this glorious hour they were determined to
rejoice. For the moment let the moment suffice! They
would give themselves up to the rapture of this little
hour.</p>

<p>Why have a care? Their pursuers were outrun. They
had the whole wide world in which to hide&mdash;the whole
wide world, which was full to the brim with glorious
adventure. They asked nothing beyond the comradeship
of each other. Let chance continue to serve them
for their modest need.</p>

<p>For their luncheon they took a young turnip out of
a field. But this did not prove a very satisfying bill
of fare. Alas! they soon began to crave an ampler
meal. Nor did this craving grow less when early in the
afternoon the sun went behind a cloud and presently a
cool wind arose accompanied by the threat of rain.</p>

<p>Turnips are doubtless excellent things, but they are
little enough upon which to maintain the fires of youth.
Thus were they driven, at whatever risk to their lives,
to strike out again toward the haunts of men. Again
was Gervase consumed by a desire to barter the silver-hilted
dagger for a flageolet by means of which he
reckoned to get pence, or failing that, he hoped to turn
the superfluous weapon into current coin of the realm.</p>

<p>They passed through several hamlets, but in none
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>did the opportunity arise of fulfilling these desires. Moreover
charity was lacking, so that by sundown a bitter
hunger took them in its grip. To add to their woes
they were again growing footsore and there had come
a change in the weather. The wind had a sting in it
and the heavy gray clouds were flying low.</p>

<p>Anne, however, was the bravest companion. She
trudged along patiently by the side of Gervase and nothing
would make her admit that she was hungry or weary
or afraid. But had it not been for the solace of each
other’s company they must have given in long before
they did. Each was sustained by the other’s valor.
Yet with night at hand, supperless and without a roof
for their heads, heaven knew what would befall them
now.</p>

<p>At last, when the cold twilight had come down on
the woods and fields, they felt no longer able to go on.
They rested awhile by the side of the road. Gervase
nestled Anne’s cheek against his coat, and it seemed
like ice.</p>

<p>“Poor soul,” he whispered, and could hardly restrain
his tears.</p>

<p>It was quite dark by the time they had gathered the
strength to continue their journey. At first their limbs
were so stiff that they could hardly walk. But the bitter
wind, the heavy darkness and the threat of rain spurred
them cruelly. Their strides grew shorter and shorter,
they fell sick at heart, yet they did not complain of one
another or of Providence.</p>

<p>On and on they trudged until they were like to drop.
Exactly what they hoped to find in that inhospitable
night was more than they could have told. Perhaps some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>hovel or shepherd’s hut or a byre with cows in it was
the bourne of their desire. But the weary miles passed
by and none of these things came to them.</p>

<p>After a time they turned from the hard and bleak
high road, which gave no protection from the merciless
wind, again into the fields. They felt now that they
could not walk another mile. Utterly weary and dispirited,
they still clung to the slender hope of finding shelter
in a wood wherein to pass the remainder of the night.
But the country now was flat and cheerless. It contained
little else than low-lying marsh-land fringed with stunted
willow-trees.</p>

<p>Disappointed of even this small crumb of solace, they
crept at last under a hedge which in the total darkness
was the best protection they could find. And grateful
were they for it. At least they were saved from the
wind and rain. But fatigue galled them in every bone
and they were most bitterly hungry.</p>

<p>They were too miserable to think of sleep. For the
sake of warmth they lay very close together, but little
enough there was of it that crept into their veins. But
never for a moment did their courage fail. They were
sustained with a sense of miraculous deliverance from
infinite perils. In body they were fainting, but in ardor
of spirit they were unconquered still. God who had
given them so much would continue to hold them in His
care.</p>

<p>Almost as if in answer to their faith they saw suddenly
a light quite near. It seemed to be no more
than a couple of fields away. Yet again, tortured by
hope, they painfully gathered their weariness and dragged
their worn-out bodies toward this fitful and unexpected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>beacon. Alas! the two fields became four and yet the
light seemed to be no nearer. But once afoot in its
quest, they stumbled on miserably through the driving
rain, in the teeth of the icy wind, over wet furrows and
through close-set hedges. On and on they stumbled, till
at last a moment came when they were like to fall in
sheer fatigue. But Providence was with them still. For
in this last dire extremity they were rewarded by the
sight of that which they had come so far to find.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE light proved to be a fire which had been
made by a band of gypsies in a corner of a field.
As Gervase and Anne approached, hope revived
them again, since a most exquisite scent of food began
to pervade their nostrils. Suspended above the fire was
an enormous cauldron from which this most delicious
savor proceeded.</p>

<p>Gervase staggered toward a very ancient crone who
was stirring the contents of the cauldron with a long-handled
iron spoon. “For love of God, good mother,”
he said, “give us leave to lie by your fire a bit. And
if we may have a share of your supper, by my soul we
will remember you in our prayers.”</p>

<p>The old woman looked at them both very doubtfully.
“Who be ye?” she asked suspiciously. “Whence come
ye?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell you, mother,” said Gervase, and
his tone was pleading hard. “But we are a-cold and
we are famishing. Do but grant us this and you shall
never have cause to rue your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Ye have the trick of fair speaking at any rate,”
said the crone. “I like the sound of your voice, young
chal. Yes, you shall eat and lie by the fire a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>The contents of the pot proved to be not less delectable
than the smell that came out of it. The crone
made free use of the large iron spoon and gave Gervase
and Anne each a huge platterful. They did not inquire
of what the savory mess consisted. It was enough
that it was good.</p>

<p>While they ate thus dim figures emerged continually
from the shadows beyond the fire. Soon these were
stretched before the pot and fell to eating also. They
were a rough, ill-kempt company. Their table manners
were none of the nicest. But they were a hearty, friendly,
genial people. They asked no questions of the guests
who lay before their fire, but rather seemed glad to find
them there. Moreover they handed about freely a flagon
of excellent ale.</p>

<p>A dozen or more of these cheerful, dark-visaged wanderers
were soon about the fire. And after supper, as
the night was still young, one of their number produced
a flageolet and began to play upon it not unpleasantly.
It was a well-toned instrument, far superior to the one
out of which the draggle-tailed wanderer of the village
street had wrung such doubtful music. Indeed Gervase,
who had the ear of the true amateur, was delighted with
the whole performance.</p>

<p>He was fain to compliment the musician upon his
melody. And in such a wonderful manner had warmth
and good cheer revived the young man’s spirits, which
less than an hour ago were at their lowest ebb, that
now he begged to be allowed to discourse a little on the
gypsy’s pipe&mdash;a request that was readily granted.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Gervase, for all that he had a
very humble estimate of his own powers, had a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>skill in this, the most charming of the arts. Upon a
natural and refined taste was grafted years of delighted
study. Moreover the instrument was rather a choice
one.</p>

<p>The gypsies had a real love of music; and when cunning
strains began to rise from their midst as they lay
round the warm fire, they were spell-bound. First Gervase
played a soft, refined piece he had learned in Italy.
Its delicacy composed the ear even while it ravished it.
Then followed bolder harmonies, less exquisite perhaps,
but none the less delightful. Finally he passed into a
couple of ranting pieces known and admired over all
the countryside.</p>

<p>When they heard these famous tunes some began to
sing and others rose and danced round the fire. They
would not hear of Gervase ceasing to play. For long
enough was he kept at his task; all kinds of revelry
accompanied the cheerful strains of the pipe, and when
at last the accomplished musician was so weary that he
could play no more it was gravely whispered about the
fire that this soft-spoken wanderer with the wonderful
gift was none other than Tat Barcey, the gentleman
prig.</p>

<p>All went well that evening with Gervase and Anne.
An almost superstitious respect was paid to them. The
old woman gave them a good place beside the fire in
which to pass the night, and when the morning came
they had another good meal.</p>

<p>The gypsies showed them so much kindness that they
were in no hurry to go forth. And before they left these
friends, so heedful were they of present opportunity, that
two things of consequence befell. In the first place a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>great desire had been kindled in Gervase to get possession
of the gypsy’s flute. Again was the dagger
with the silver hilt produced. Devoutly he hoped it would
be deemed a full equivalent for the thing he coveted.</p>

<p>The owner of the flute examined the weapon closely.
Gervase’s heart began to beat excitedly. At that moment
he desired the flute beyond anything else in the world.
The value of the dagger tempted the gypsy to make the
exchange. “Why, yes,” said he, “certainly I will.”</p>

<p>When Gervase was given the pipe he felt a thrill of
joy, for here was a means of life.</p>

<p>But this was not the end of their good luck.</p>

<p>It was most necessary that Anne should disguise her
sex at the first opportunity. The hawking-breeches and
long boots of untanned leather surmounted by a woman’s
bodice and feminine canopy of curls had already excited
remark. Therefore was the crone persuaded to cut off
the long tresses with a pair of shears, and out of the
gypsies’ wardrobe she provided a boy’s leather jerkin
and a cap to match it in exchange for the woman’s gear
that Anne was wearing.</p>

<p>A great change was wrought thereby in her appearance.
She was no more a maid. Her thin, tall figure,
graceful as a willow, did remarkably well for that of a
very slender boy. Charming she looked; her form was
of a singular delicacy, but it passed very well for that
of a boy. Awkward questions need no longer be feared
along the road. Both were now unmistakably of the
sterner sex in the sight of all men.</p>

<p>They went forth in good heart. Armed with this
blessed pipe no longer need they fear for a modest sustenance
by the way, unless they should fall in with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>singularly barren land or one notoriously averse from
music.</p>

<p>All the same they must use great caution. It had
been proved to them already that the chase was like to
be hot at their heels. Still if they kept to little frequented
places, there was for the present a chance of
eluding their pursuers. But beyond that they did not
dare to hope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM this time forth, as far as it was possible,
Gervase and Anne kept to the woods and the fields.
For several weeks they yielded themselves to a
free life in the open. Drenched by the rains, combed
by the winds, baked by the sun, they soon became as
brown as berries.</p>

<p>All day would they wander hand in hand. But this
was a state of things that could not last. A clear
conviction had grown up in the heart of Gervase that a
term had been set to his days. At any moment he might
be taken. Therefore would he have his taste of life.</p>

<p>He welcomed nature in all her moods. He basked in
her sunlight, he turned his face to her winds, he rejoiced
when her sudden plumps of rain drenched him
to the skin. And the brave thing, ever beside him, to
whom he owed the life which was still his, she too in her
courage and devotion was in a mood of highest fortitude.</p>

<p>Come what might, they would live their hour. Already
Anne had made a vow that when the call came
to Gervase she would obey it too. When that dread
hour came in which they could no longer put off their
captors they were resolved to die together. Soon or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>late a tragic fate must overtake them. But in the meantime
let them taste of life in its abundance, let
them rejoice in the ever-mounting passion of their
love.</p>

<p>Often a barn or a byre sufficed for their night’s lodging,
but they seldom lacked food. Even in the most
rural places Gervase’s skill upon the flute, blended occasionally
with the fresh and charming voice of Anne,
hardly ever failed to bring a few pence which served to
buy them a meal.</p>

<p>It was a good life and yet a very hard one. They
dared not venture into the larger places where pence
might have been more plentiful. Thus for the most
part the fare was coarse and scanty, and often were
their bones a mass of aches from the unkindness of their
couches. They were tanned like gypsies, fine-drawn as
greyhounds; and all too soon their clothes began to display
holes and tatters in spite of the care with which
they tended them.</p>

<p>Small wonder was it that as the days passed this
severe life of the road began to pall. Greatly as they
exulted in their freedom, they began to long intensely
for gentler fare. Besides, they were inclined to view
their perils more lightly. Nerved by hardship, very
hungry and also grown a little desperate after a long
succession of most uncomfortable days and nights,
they found themselves on a glorious morning in the
streets of the famous town of Oxford. And here a thing
befell that was to change the current of their lives.</p>

<p>It was hardly more than eight o’clock by the time they
came into the Cornmarket, where stood the Crown Tavern,
which was the principal inn in the city. The season
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>was June, and young as was the day the sun was already
hot in a sky that was without a cloud.</p>

<p>A man dressed neatly in a doublet of black velvet, and
with a short cock’s feather in his hat, sat on a bench in
the sun by the tavern door. On his knees was a mass
of papers which he was studying intently. The expression
upon his face was a little dubious at times, and
more than a little pensive at others. Now and again
as he read he indulged in a trick of brushing back his
rather long hair with the palm of his hand, and to this
he had free recourse when he came to a passage in the
close-written folio that particularly engaged his attention.</p>

<p>As the strains of Gervase’s flute, mingled with the notes
of Anne’s rather plaintive treble, caught the man’s ear
he paused suddenly in his task. With an eager, inquiring
eye that was singularly searching he looked up;
and as it fell upon the pair of vagabonds who were
coming slowly across the Cornmarket toward where
he sat, there was something in their aspect which
seemed to arouse his curiosity. At any rate he laid
his papers down on the bench, and regarded the musician
and the singer with an air of great candor and
interest.</p>

<p>It may have been that the performance on the flute
struck him as possessing a merit beyond the common,
or it may have been that the sweetly plaintive voice
touched a chord in his heart, or again it may have been
that some subtle quality in the aspect of these ragged
robins spoke to him. For at least his scrutiny was grave,
direct, very regardful. It was as if he saw, beyond the
tawny skins, the unkempt locks, the tattered clothes, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>underlying strangeness as of something far other than
was as yet revealed.</p>

<p>So oddly was this man taken by the appearance of
these wanderers that when they halted, rather timidly as
it seemed, some twenty paces from where he sat, he was
fain to beckon to them to come nearer. Yes, here were
youth and grace indeed, and beneath their tan was an
unmistakable beauty. Very slowly and very gravely
the man on the tavern bench looked them up and down
from top to toe.</p>

<p>“Playing for a breakfast, young sir?” he said in a tone
of amused friendliness, when at last this scrutiny was at
an end.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we be,” said Gervase.</p>

<p>Of late the young man had affected a kind of Doric
in his speech, the better to accord with an appearance
that grew more and more rustical. But as soon as the
man heard the tone of his voice a smile played furtively
upon his lips.</p>

<p>Again were those observing eyes directed upon Gervase
and Anne. There was neither unkindness nor impertinence
in that whimsical gaze. It was hardly more
than the sympathetic curiosity of a subtle mind in the
presence of a mystery it is tempted to solve. But to
Gervase at least it brought a sense of discomfort. The
man’s whole aspect made him feel that here was a
mental power, a faculty of divination far beyond the
common.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the man, with a disarming air of
courtesy, “if I may say so, you perform so choicely
upon the flute that you should seldom go wanting a
meal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, sir, we lack one sometimes,” said Gervase.</p>

<p>“There should be no occasion to do so this morning
at least. Persons of taste abound in this old university
town.”</p>

<p>“That is good news, sir,” said Gervase guardedly.</p>

<p>“And had I been bred at this ancient seat of learning
I myself might have claimed to be of their number.”
So soft and gentle was the tone of the man’s voice
that Gervase was set more than ever upon his guard.</p>

<p>The young man tried to show by a gesture that the
conversation was being carried above the plane on which
his bucolic wits were accustomed to move. But unhappily
its very politeness defeated the object in view. No
rustic since the world began had ever been able to convey
a deprecation so delicate in a manner so urbane.</p>

<p>The man could not forbear to be amused. “Well,
sir,” said he, “let me make myself clearer. May I, as
a humble lover of the arts, offer a breakfast to you and
your friend in order to celebrate your genius upon the
flute?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, you may,” said Gervase, with grateful
alacrity, and casting all prudence to the wind.</p>

<p>The man bowed as if aware that an honor had been
done him. “Is there any particular dish, sir, you crave
for your breakfast?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying to the question Gervase looked at
Anne, as if he desired that in a matter of such importance
hers should be the responsibility of choosing.</p>

<p>Quick to follow the glance, as he was quick to follow
all things, the man was fain to take it for his guide.
“What do you desire for your breakfast, young sir?”
he said to Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“A dish of sweetbreads, if it please you,” said Anne,
without an instant’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“The devil you do!” The man broke into a cry of
laughter. “You eat delicate, young sir. Is a dish of
sweetbreads your usual fare of a morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Anne. “But you asked me what I would
like for my breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Well, young gypsy, you shall have ’em, confound me
if you shall not, if good Mistress Davenant can rise to
such fare. I will go and inquire.”</p>

<p>The man gathered his papers, rose from the bench
and entered the tavern.</p>

<p>Anne and Gervase were left on the threshold to speculate,
perhaps a little dubiously, upon this new turn in
their fortunes. Gervase was already spurring his memory
to recall who this man might be. He had the clearest
recollection of having seen him before. But where
he had seen him and in what circumstances he could not
remember just then. Still, he felt not the least distrust
of him. The countenance was subtle enough,
and wholly unlike that of any other man, but it had
also a frankness, a candor, a large geniality which wholly
forbade the idea of treachery.</p>

<p>Soon the man returned with a roguish light in his eye
and the assurance that Mistress Davenant would furnish
a dish of sweetbreads in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>These were glad tidings. Gervase rendered his thanks
in his best Doric and begged to be allowed the use of
the pump in the courtyard of the inn. Surely such a
noble repast called for some amenity on the part of those
who would yield to its delights.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN a few minutes later Gervase and Anne,
as wholesome as the pump in the courtyard
could make them, were ushered by their new
friend into the breakfast parlor of the Crown, they
learned without surprise that his calling was that of a
play-actor. Several of his colleagues were seated at a
long table that ran along the center of the room.</p>

<p>This man’s entrance with two nut-brown vagabonds,
whose clothes were in tatters and had the appearance
of having been drawn through a hedge, gave rise to not
a little curiosity. And when he led them to a small
table spread for three persons that was set in an embrasure
of the window looking on to the street, and sat
down to eat with them, covert glances were stolen at so
singular a spectacle by more than one member of the
Lord Chamberlain’s Company.</p>

<p>Still, even in that age there was a certain indulgence
among the elect for a man of acknowledged genius. And
of such persons whom nature and fortune had favored
there was a number round the table in the center of
the room. At the foot of it, immediately opposite the
vacant place of his slightly eccentric co-manager, was
Richard Burbage, who had recently built the fine new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>playhouse on the Bankside in Southwark, and who was
held by all whose opinion was of weight to be the first
tragic actor of the time. Near to him was William Kemp,
the famous comedian, a burly, rubicund fellow, whose
rolling, unctuous tones had been nourished upon many an
honest quart of sack. Farther along the board were
such excellent mimes as Taylor and Lowin and Heming
and Harrison, men highly accomplished in their calling,
and of whom any body of players had a right to be
proud.</p>

<p>The Lord Chamberlain’s servants were on the floodside
of success. At this time they were going from
strength to strength and outdistancing all competitors.
Even the Lord Admiral’s men had grown to envy them.
These were no unworthy rivals; men of wit and parts
from the universities were writing plays for them, but
they had not the good fortune to be inspired by a man
of very brilliant and remarkable genius.</p>

<p>Richard Burbage’s co-director and part-proprietor of
the new theater on the Bankside was William Shakespeare,
like all of these men an actor, and perhaps a
rather mediocre one. Yet wild horses would not have
dragged any such admission from his more accomplished
brethren. For these well knew that this man, whose air
was so modest, so charming and so friendly, was one
whose own special gift was beyond all price. Times and
again, at the shortest notice, had he taken the lifeless
corpse of a forgotten play and with a few magic touches
had made the dry bones live.</p>

<p>More than once had Richard Burbage gone to him
with a demand for “something new for Twelfth Night.”
And as sure as Burbage had done so something new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>had been forthcoming; a piece such as to make the town
ring, and cause the Admiral’s men to bite their nails with
envy. Plays of all kinds, running through the whole
gamut of the emotions, had William Shakespeare devised.
All sorts and conditions of men had been enthralled by his
remarkable talent.</p>

<p>“What new maggot has Will got in his brain?” inquired
the famous Kemp of the still more famous Burbage
as he rolled a large and rather bloodshot eye in
the direction of the window.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the tragedian, with an indulgent shake of
the head, “I know not, except that, as he would say, he
is studying the great human comedy.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dick,” said the comedian, “if you and I did
not know that he had rarer wit than any man alive we
should think he was as mad as a March hare.”</p>

<p>“It is a form of madness, friend William, that will
never trouble you and me,” said the tragedian, fetching
a deep sigh in which there was more than a suspicion
of the idolater.</p>

<p>Richard Burbage in particular was sealed of the tribe.
In those reverent eyes the true prince had no peer. The
tragedian was not only a magnificent actor; he was also
an uncommonly shrewd and practical man of the world.
He of all men was able to appraise the merit of William
Shakespeare. Burbage knew that his touch had an astonishing
mastery. He knew Shakespeare to be an incomparable
craftsman who had already furnished him
with wonderful parts in which to display his own
genius. Moreover the tragedian firmly believed that this
wonderful man carried many another fine play as yet
unborn in his brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>It mattered not what the theme was. It might be as
old as the moon or it might be invented expressly for
the Globe Theatre, but as soon as William Shakespeare
took the pen in his hand the realms of gold were unlocked.
An incommunicable thrill was given to the stale
old plot; the light that never was on sea or land glowed
over it; every line acquired a cadence, a fire, a magic
that Richard Burbage, acknowledged monarch of its interpreters,
knew to be incomparable.</p>

<p>In the presence of the other members of the company,
and particularly in that of the younger ones, Burbage
would often allude to the playwright in terms of awe.
His attitude of whimsical adoration was apt to amuse
his brethren not a little at times. Whenever the playwright
expressed an opinion on things and men&mdash;and an
uncommonly shrewd one it was as a rule&mdash;it could count
invariably on the approval of Richard Burbage. Furthermore
all that he was moved to say or do had some
high sanction in the sight of the tragedian.</p>

<p>There might be those at that table less prone to idolatry.
Some of the younger men, having much to learn,
were tempted to smile at the spectacle of their chief
sitting apart with a pair of nondescript vagabonds, who
to judge by their clothes were no more than a couple of
strolling Egyptians. But with Burbage and Kemp this
was by no means an occasion for levity. Their implicit
faith in their colleague enabled them to see method in his
madness.</p>

<p>“Another of his discoveries, I trow, Dick,” said William
Kemp, with a sly glance in the direction of the window.</p>

<p>“You can lay your sweet life upon that,” said the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>tragedian, fixing a stern eye upon a somewhat froward
junior a little farther down the table. “Do you mind
how he found Edgcumbe and where he found him?”</p>

<p>“That I do, and Crosby too and Parflete also if it
comes to that. There is not a man in all England has
such an eye for a youth of likelihood.”</p>

<p>Nor had this view to wait long for confirmation. Presently
the playwright rose from his seat by the window
and came over to the long table. There was an expression
of keen pleasure upon his face. He laid an affectionate
hand upon Burbage’s shoulder. “Dick,” he said,
“we are in luck. I’ve found two of the prettiest boys
I have seen this many a moon. Well-mannered, gentle-spoke,
right excellent in address. One plays the flute in
the manner of a musician; and the other is straight and
limber, soft-voiced and neat-legged. There is the making
of such a <i>Rosalind</i> there as Parflete himself could not
better. Give your old nose one more dip i’ th’ tankard,
Dickon, and then come over and pass the time o’ the
day with my dainty young Egyptians.”</p>

<p>The tragedian needed no second invitation, but with
a “There-what-did-I-tell-you!” expression of countenance
accompanied William Shakespeare to the table by
the window.</p>

<p>“This is my friend Burbage,” said the playwright to
the brown and handsome Egyptians. “Not of much
account as an actor, I am afraid, but without a superior
in the handling of a tankard with a toast in it or in
tossing off a cup of sack either before or after supper.”</p>

<p>Gervase and Anne rose from the table and bowed respectfully
to the tall, grave and dignified tragedian who
yet had a subtle light of humor in his eye.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>
<p>Now the name of William Shakespeare was already
familiar to Gervase. He had heard his kinsman speak
of him with high approval. Moreover Gervase had sat
on the stage at the theater and seen him perform in a
number of his own plays. To be sure he was nothing
great as an actor, but those who could judge of such
things, his cousin Harry to wit, were of opinion that
he was without a peer as a deviser of plays.</p>

<p>But whatever the man was or whatever he was not,
in the estimation of Gervase he was undoubtedly a very
agreeable follow. He had given them a delightful breakfast.
He had regaled them with free and lively discourse.
Also he had depicted the life of an actor&mdash;particularly
of one who had the good fortune to be taken into
the Lord Chamberlain’s Company&mdash;in most glowing colors.
Nor had even this contented him. He had ended
by making them a formal offer to join that famous band.</p>

<p>They should have clothes of a good style and quality;
their cheer should be abundant; they should be comfortably
housed and cared for; and during the first
year of their apprenticeship they should receive a tester a
day. The whole craft of the theater should be taught
them; they should tread the boards of the Globe; and,
with due diligence, upon a day they might hope to play
before the Queen at Richmond or Greenwich.</p>

<p>It was an alluring prospect that the actor had painted
with a lively and glowing fancy. And now that Burbage
had seen these singularly attractive youths and had
learned that Shakespeare had set his heart on securing
them for the Lord Chamberlain’s Company, they had the
tragedian’s wiles of speech to combat.</p>

<p>Gervase was tempted sorely. The hard life of the road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>was growing intolerable. Food was scarce, beds hard
and often to seek; they were continually exposed to the
weather in all its inclemency; they were haunted by a
constant sense of peril. Should they exchange all this
discomfort for the happier prospect that was now dangled
before them?</p>

<p>It was a grave problem and one that called for much
hard thought.</p>

<p>“’Tis the finest profession in the world,” said the tragedian,
with the light of enthusiasm in his eyes, “and
you, with your looks and address, are bound to rise in
it. Twenty years ago I was by trade a carpenter, and
as for Will here he was even less than that.”</p>

<p>It was not, however, the worldly advantages of a player’s
calling that were making their appeal to Gervase.
No doubt they were considerable, for both of these men
had prosperity written upon them. It was not for these
things that he cared, however, nor overmuch for his
own ease and security. But for Anne, poor brave Anne
who was already beginning to fail from sheer fatigue, it
would mean a far gentler way of life.</p>

<p>When, however, Gervase came to consider the alternative
that was offered he could not be blind to its perils.
It was bound to mean a life of publicity, in places moreover
in which he was likely to be known. No; the more
thought he gave to the matter, the clearer his conviction
grew that it would add tenfold to their dangers if
they threw in their lot with the Lord Chamberlain’s men.</p>

<p>Gervase liked so well these honest, genial and courteous
fellows and the gay, free and pleasant life they
offered that it went to his heart that he could not answer
in the way he would have chosen. What a boon such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>a life would have been, what a relief from the hard road
and the open sky! Day by day their case was growing
worse. But they must not yield to these beguilements so
long as they set any value on their lives.</p>

<p>It was with much reluctance that in the end Gervase
informed the players that he and his companion could
not throw in their lot with the Lord Chamberlain’s servants.
They were sensible of the liberal offer that had
been made to them; they expressed all proper gratitude
for it, but their business lay otherwhere.</p>

<p>The playwright in particular was much disappointed.
Already he had begun to count upon a couple of most
promising recruits. The shy grace, the light-flanked slenderness
of the younger gypsy had especially intrigued
that perceiving eye. But it was in vain that Shakespeare
pointed out the advantages such a mode of life afforded
over their present one. It was in vain that he assembled
all the glowing colors of his fancy to depict it.</p>

<p>“I would, sir, that we might do as you wish,” said
Gervase, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>The keen-witted player was quick to notice the wistful
tone of the voice, the look of pain in the eyes. All at
once it came into his mind that this young man was not
what he appeared to be.</p>

<p>Surely he had seen this young man before. For the
life of him he could not then say when it was or where,
but he had not the least doubt that he had met him in very
different circumstances. Yet his delicacy of mind was
such that the knowledge that he had come to the threshold
of a mystery made him less insistent than he would
have been otherwise.</p>

<p>Presently with many sincere expressions of gratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Anne and Gervase took the road again. As Shakespeare
watched them depart his professional feelings got
the better of him. “Dick,” he said to his faithful henchman,
“I am sore to see them go. No two such springalds
as those, so fair, sweet and likely, have I seen for a
month o’ Sundays.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said Richard Burbage sagely.</p>

<p>“Still, things are not always what they seem, Dickon,”
said the playwright.</p>

<p>“How mean you, you old wiseacre?” The tragedian
linked his arm affectionately within that of his friend.
“What new hare is started in that wild demesne which
you are pleased to call your mind?”</p>

<p>“I mean, dear shrew, that those are no more gypsies
than Richard Burbage is Emperor of Cathay.”</p>

<p>“Then who the plague be they?”</p>

<p>“Ha! you have me there. But I’ll wager there is
far more in this matter than meets the eye.”</p>

<p>“So be it, then,” said the tragedian, rolling his rich
voice. “But in the meantime let us see if a large cup
of sack will sharpen your recollection, you subtle-minded
maker of plays.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>LAS! a large cup of sack did little to sharpen the
remembrance of Mr. William Shakespeare. It
was in vain that he brought his mind to bear upon
the problem that now engaged it. He felt sure he had
seen both the gypsies before, and in very different circumstances;
slight threads of recollection were alive in his
memory, but for the life of him he could not piece them
together into any hopeful clue.</p>

<p>The playwright spent the rest of the morning on a
bench in the sun before the door of the Crown, conning
diligently the close-written sheets of the latest heir
of his invention.</p>

<p>Art is long, time fleeting. He read with mingled feelings:
relief that the thing was done at last; regret of
the true artist that it was not to be done all over again,
so far it was from those first blithe runnings of the
fancy which had peopled his mind with such glad shapes
as no eye of mortal could ever look upon. Even now
it wanted a title, this pleasant conceited comedy. And
how was it possible to find a name for this absurd, sweetly
foolish fantasy of the greenwood and a banished
duke, of love and girlhood and high poesy?</p>

<p>Art is long, time fleeting. It was a poor thing, but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>would have to serve, since the Queen had called for it to
be played before her next Thursday se’nnight in her
palace at Richmond. And it made the playwright sigh to
think that there was only young Parflete to play <i>Rosalind</i>,
that fair emblem of victorious girlhood, upon which
he had feasted and quickened his imagination. The
prosperity of the play depended on a single character,
and Parflete, with all his grace and talent, came not near
the poet’s ideal of the part. Perhaps no mortal youth
could ever hope to do that, and yet what a glorious
<i>Rosalind</i> had walked up that street but an hour ago!</p>

<p>It was a stroke of perverse fate that his eyes had been
ravished by that charming gypsy boy. But for that
sight, Parflete, for whom the part had been designed
from the first, would have contented him. But now
having seen the true <i>Rosalind</i>, for all that he was so
fine-drawn and shy, so ill-kempt and rustical, it made
the poet sad to think of Parflete in the rôle, youth of
breeding and talent as he was.</p>

<p>The playwright sighed heavily as he turned the last
page. Alas! he felt already that he had leaned too heavily
on his chief female character. Oh, if&mdash;! But such
a speculation was idle ... he must dismiss it. Let him
spend his mind more profitably in seeking a name for
the plaguy piece. But how was it possible to find a
name for such a patched coat of fantasy?</p>

<p>While William Shakespeare was in this mental
travail, his friend Richard Burbage came out of the
tavern. “Dick,” said he, “of your charity give me a
name for this curst piece. I know no more what to
christen it than does a blind tinker his dog.”</p>

<p>Richard Burbage removed from his mouth his pipe of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>tobacco, a fashionable action which seemed to call for a
slight air of magniloqence. “A name, my William, for
the curst piece?” The tragedian shrugged his shoulders
and spread his hands nonchalantly, while the light of a
large good-humor shone in his shrewd face. “Oh, call
it as you like it or what you will.”</p>

<p>The fist of the playwright descended upon the bench
in front of him. “Dick, you’ve hit it at the first shot!”
he cried. “As You Like It!&mdash;you’ve hit the target right
in the middle.”</p>

<p>“Why take two bites at a cherry, my son?” said the
tragedian, with another amused shrug. “In fact, the
matter merely amounts to this: If William Shakespeare
of Stratford-on-Avon in Warwickshire, would engage
one Richard Burbage, an honest good fellow, to write
his plaguy pieces for him, it would save him a vast deal
of trouble and inconvenience and the world would never
be able to tell the difference.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Richard Burbage sauntered back into
the Crown Tavern with that large air of benevolent tolerance
which should be the attitude of a superior mind
toward all men and all things.</p>

<p>“As You Like It,” said the playwright. “The name
is as good as a better, confound me if it is not!”</p>

<p>He dipped his quill into the horn of ink that was on
the bench beside him, and, with the never-failing instinct
of the true craftsman, wrote the title on the first page
of his new comedy.</p>

<p>Scarce had he time to do this, however, when that
swift, alert and curious mind was engaged by an entirely
new affair. There was the sound of a horse’s
hoofs on the cobbles leading to the tavern door. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>the playwright’s quick uplooking glance was met by the
sight of a singular traveler.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a man about twenty-five years
old, riding a useful-looking horse. But that which particularly
drew the notice of William Shakespeare was the
hapless plight of man and beast. Both were greatly
distressed. The horse had evidently traveled far and
swiftly: it was caked with mud up to its withers; it was
lame of a foreleg; it was covered with sweat, and seemed
hardly able to do another yard.</p>

<p>The case of the rider was in keeping with the horse’s
unhappy state. The man looked so limp and wretched
that he could scarce sit in the saddle. Moreover, he
was wild-eyed and haggard; and his leather riding-suit
which seemed to denote a servant of a superior sort
was in sad disorder.</p>

<p>The man rode into the courtyard of the inn and handed
over his weary horse to an ostler. Then the rider, no
less weary than his steed, staggered painfully to the inn
door. In a hoarse voice he called for a tankard of ale
and then flung himself heavily on the bench near to
where the player sat.</p>

<p>Shakespeare eyed the traveler with deep curiosity.
The man was in such a sorry plight that he could not
refrain from pitying him. “You appear to have traveled
far, friend,” he said.</p>

<p>The man looked at the speaker in a manner to suggest
that he might be strongly averse from the delights
of promiscuous conversation with a total stranger. “Yes,
I have traveled far,” he said, with a weary sigh.</p>

<p>He buried his head in his hands as if he were in
despair. And even after refreshment had been brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>to him he did not heed it, but continued in this attitude
for some little time. Then suddenly he shook off his
lethargy and drank the ale. Feeling a little renewed, he
called for a second tankard.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to have seen a couple o’ young
gypsies traveling through Oxford?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Immediately the player grew very alert. “What kind
of gypsies do you mean?” he asked in a casual but wary
tone.</p>

<p>“The taller of the two might be playing on the flute, I
reckon, and the younger one, who has the voice and look
of a girl, might doubtless be singing.”</p>

<p>William Shakespeare, as became a thoroughgoing man
of the world, was far too acute to blurt out on the spur
of the moment the full measure of his information.
Rather he preferred to parry the question of this singular
traveler by putting a few of his own. “What might
you be wanting with them?” he asked cautiously.</p>

<p>The traveler drank copiously of his second pot of ale
before he answered. And when answer he did it was
in the rather surly manner of one who strongly desires
to keep his own counsel and yet is not well enough
trained in the art of politeness to be able to keep it gracefully.
“That’s my affair,” he said bluntly.</p>

<p>The player was too wise a man to pursue his inquiry
at the moment. But by now his curiosity was fully engaged.
There was a mystery here. And mystery of any
sort was apt to engage that subtle mind. When he had
first set eyes on that picturesque pair of young vagabonds
he had been strongly inclined to believe that they were
other than they seemed. Now this man’s coming, his
agitation and his secrecy confirmed him in that theory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<p>Clearly there was a good deal more in this matter than
met the eye. The player was convinced that he had
seen both these ragged robbins before. And in some
vague way he felt he had seen them in circumstances
and surroundings wholly different from those in which
they were at present.</p>

<p>He knew how to keep his own counsel, however. It
was left to the traveler himself to renew the topic. And
this the man presently did, and in the manner of one
who against his natural judgment is driven by some remorseless,
some irresistible force.</p>

<p>“Did you say you <i>had</i> seen a pair o’ gypsies pass along
the road?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I say neither that I have nor that I have not,” said
the player. “Still, if you care to tell me more it is possible
that I may be able to help you. But,” he added,
with well-assumed indifference, “after all, it is hardly
likely that the persons I have in mind are those whom you
are seeking.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated as one impaled on the horns of a
dilemma. Evidently he was very loath to tell all he
knew. Yet at the same time he realized that the information
he sought could only be won by a measure of
frankness on his own part. After a careful weighing of
the pros and cons of the matter he seemed reluctantly to
conclude that his silence might lose him more than it
would gain.</p>

<p>“I know not who you are,” he said at last. “But you
have a fair-seeming air and the face of an honest man.
And God send you are all of what you appear, for it is
a very strange and grievous story that I have to tell.”</p>

<p>The traveler spoke in the manner of one who is entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
desperate. He seemed to have been driven to the
limit of his mental as well as his physical endurance.</p>

<p>In the face of the player was that beacon of true sympathy
which is as a talisman in the sight of all men.
He had the power to put himself in the place of others.
And here was a kindness, a candor, an openness for all
men to read, and reading for all men to trust implicitly.</p>

<p>“My story is one you will find very hard to believe,”
said the young man. “But there is no reason why it
should not be told. It is in the power of no man to make
things in a worse coil than they are. And while I do
not think aught is to be gained by making others a party
to them, after all it can do no harm, and I may even gain
a certain ease of mind.”</p>

<p>The player showed very clearly that he was following
every word with the closest and most sympathetic attention.</p>

<p>“To begin at the beginning of my story,” said the
young man, “my name is John Markham. My calling is
that of a falconer. I have been eight years in the service
of Sir John Feversham, who is Constable of Nottingham
Castle, and chief justice of the Forest of Sherwood.
He has the reputation of being a hard man. But I have
always found him a very just one. Moreover I say to
you, whoever you be, that no man could desire a better
master.</p>

<p>“Well, to come at once to this dreadful story, which
it hurts me to tell, some months ago, six perhaps or more&mdash;at
least it was in the fall of the year&mdash;the Queen
caused to be imprisoned privily in the Castle a Mr.
Gervase Heriot. He was a highly placed young man.
But he had mixed with the Papists, and after a trial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>which had been held in secret before the Court of Star
Chamber, he had been found guilty of complicity in the
Round House Plot, which you may know had for its object
the taking the Queen’s life. By a good providence
the plot was discovered in time, but the conspirators
were able to fly the country, except Mr. Heriot,
who alone was taken.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot, as I say, was tried in secret, because
the Queen’s advisers were anxious not to inflame the
public mind, and they wished as little as possible to be
made of so ugly a matter. Mr. Heriot was proved guilty
of conspiring against the life of the Queen, and he
was committed to the Castle of Nottingham to be held
there by Sir John Feversham, my master, until such
time as her pleasure concerning him should be further
known.</p>

<p>“Some two months ago the Queen signed the warrant
for Mr. Heriot’s death. The day for the execution was
fixed. And now I come to the strange, the grievous,
the incredible part of the story.” In the sudden flood
of his emotion the falconer’s voice almost failed. “On
the very morning that Mr. Heriot was to die by the ax
on the block, within three hours of the time appointed,
he escaped from his durance.”</p>

<p>The young man could not go on. But the unspoken
sympathy of his auditor nerved him to continue. Yet
as he did so a kind of tragic horror entered his voice.</p>

<p>“At first nothing was known of the circumstances of
Mr. Heriot’s escape. Yet without loss of time all of
us of the Constable’s household who were able of body
mounted our horses and rode off in all directions in order
that the prisoner might be retaken. And it fell to me as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>I rode that same morning in the meadows beside the
Trent to come upon Mr. Heriot hiding in the grass.”</p>

<p>For a moment the unhappy young man covered his
face with his hands. It was as if he was wholly unable
to proceed with his story or to contemplate that which
was coming.</p>

<p>With an ever-mounting interest William Shakespeare
waited in silence for this emotion to pass.</p>

<p>“I had but to speak,” the young man was able to continue
at last. “I had but to cry out to my comrades, who
were less than fifty yards off, and the prisoner would
have been ta’en. But I did not do this.”</p>

<p>Again came a dire threat from an overwrought mind,
but with a powerful effort of will the falconer was able
to proceed with his story.</p>

<p>“But I did not do this, for beside him in the grass was
Mistress Anne Feversham, the daughter of the Constable
my master.”</p>

<p>A sharp cry broke from the lips of William Shakespeare.
He rose from the bench in the stress of his excitement.</p>

<p>“You let them go free!” said the player.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the falconer. “I had it not in my heart
to take them when she, for whom I would have given
my life, had given hers for the man she loved better
than her own soul.”</p>

<p>The face of the player was all melted with compassion.
His eyes of strange somberness grew fixed and
dark.</p>

<p>“But this is not the end of what I have to tell,” said
the falconer. “I let Mr. Heriot and my young mistress
go free; yet before that day was out the truth came to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>the Constable my master, that it was his own daughter
who had contrived the prisoner’s escape and that she
was away with him over the country-side. And my master,
being one to whom honor is a jewel, posted at once
to the Queen to her palace at Greenwich. With his own
lips he told her that Mr. Heriot was broken free. And
not a word did he speak of the part his daughter had
borne in the affair, but took the whole blame of the
matter upon himself.</p>

<p>“They say that when Sir John told the news to the
Queen her displeasure was terrible. They say that his
story&mdash;as in faith it must with the chief part of it left
out&mdash;carried so little credence to her mind that she at
once suspected him of treachery, old and loyal servant
as he was. She had him straightway committed to the
Tower. He is to stand immediate trial before the Court
of the Star Chamber on a charge of aiding and abetting
the escape of a prisoner of state. And as I learn from
those best able to judge of such a grievous matter,
my master, unless the prisoner is retaken at once, will
without a doubt be condemned to the block.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare had followed with a growing excitement
as strange a story as he had ever heard in his life. There
were elements in it which appealed intensely to his
dramatic sense. Besides, he did not doubt that two of
the chief actors in the tragedy were very close at hand.
He did not doubt that they were that fascinating pair
of vagabonds who had wrought upon his curiosity so short
a time ago.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ELDOM had the mind of William Shakespeare
been exercised more severely than in this hour.
No story could have been more poignant. Yet
was it the duty even of a true subject and of an honest
man to confide to the distraught John Markham his
knowledge of the nearness of those whom he sought?</p>

<p>Anxiously he considered this problem; but the more
thought he gave to it, the more baffling and complex
seemed to be the difficulties it presented.</p>

<p>Shakespeare talked long and earnestly with the falconer
as they sat out in the sun on the tavern bench.
And the result of this intimate conversation was that
he came to form a high regard for the character of this
unhappy man.</p>

<p>The mind of the poor fellow was grievously tormented.
On the one side was worship of his young
mistress; on the other his fealty to a good and honored
master. He was as one rent in twain. A high adoration
had divorced him from his duty, and now, in
horror of an action that was to cost his master his life,
he was determined to do all that lay in his power to
repair his crime.</p>

<p>Up hill and down dale, in all weathers, at all hours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>of the day and night, had he journeyed for more than
a fortnight past. Far over the country-side by little-frequented
ways had he ridden in his quest of the fugitives.
Now did he hear of them from one of whom a
few days before they had obtained a night’s lodging;
now from a masterless man upon the road; now from
a tribe of wandering gypsies; now from the keeper of an
alehouse. He was ever upon the point of coming up
with them, yet ever by the interposition of some strange
providence had they eluded him.</p>

<p>As Shakespeare listened to the tale of John Markham’s
wanderings the sore problem was ever posed before
his mind. Should he discover to the distraught falconer
the whereabouts of the fugitives? Must he set
him upon the road they had taken but a brief two hours
ago?</p>

<p>It was not at once that the player could come to a
resolve. Indeed an extension of time was unexpectedly
granted to him, for as John Markham sat on the bench
in the sun a great fatigue suddenly overcame the young
man and he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Thereupon the player retired to the pleasant garden
at the back of the inn. Here he paced up and down the
box-bordered paths with his hands tucked deep in his
doublet.</p>

<p>To him presently came Richard Burbage.</p>

<p>“Oho, my William,” said the tragedian. “Piecing out,
I presume, a further parcel of neat verses for the fair
Rosalind?”</p>

<p>“No, Dick, a greater affair than that is toward.”</p>

<p>The tone banished all levity from Burbage’s lips.
“Why, what is the matter?” he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>“Must I tell it or must I not?” The playwright
seemed to be thinking aloud. Then he broke out with a
kind of petulance. “I would to heaven I was not curst
with this fell disease!”</p>

<p>“Which of your fell diseases is that, dear coz?”</p>

<p>“The bitterest of them all&mdash;the disease of not being
able to know your own mind.”</p>

<p>“The penalty of high imagination, my friend,” said
Richard Burbage, with an air of understanding and sympathy.</p>

<p>“You are right, Dickon. The penalty of imagination,
as you say. One of these days I will take a revenge upon
myself and make a play of it. It is the bitterest thing
in the world. There’s no peace in this life for those
who suffer it. But I have here a matter in which I
crave your help. Sit ye there, by the yew-tree yonder,
and I will unfold the most tragical tale that ever came
from the lips of man.”</p>

<p>Burbage sat as his friend desired. In spite of his
colleague’s perplexed face he was prepared for one of
those odd, fantastic, whimsical inventions that often
enough had been poured into his ear. But this was to
prove another kind of matter altogether.</p>

<p>The story did not take long in the telling. The tragedian
was thrilled by it. He listened with fascinated
attention.</p>

<p>“And now, Dick,” said the playwright when he had
come to the end of the tragic story, “I ask you what is
to be done?”</p>

<p>“Aye, what indeed!” said Burbage in his deep voice.</p>

<p>“God help them, poor souls!” said the poet tenderly.</p>

<p>“Amen to that!” said Burbage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>These were wise men. There were few of the coils
that fate weaves for her children with which they were
unacquainted. But here was a matter which in its sinister
and tragic complexity seemed to lie beyond their
grasp.</p>

<p>The problem was indeed a sore one. They were true
subjects of the Queen. As loyal, chivalrous and honorable
men they could appreciate the cruel pass of the
unfortunate Sir John Feversham, and also of the ill-starred
falconer. But how was it possible to deliver up
two such fugitives, two who were little more than children,
who had dared and done so much, to the vengeance
of the law?</p>

<p>“I ask you, Dick, what is to be done?” said the playwright.</p>

<p>The tragedian sat with his head in his hands, the picture
of desolation.</p>

<p>“Nay, Will,” he said haplessly, “you would do better
to consult God and your own conscience.”</p>

<p>“An’ I do that,” said the playwright, “a curse will lie
on my soul for ever-more.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER their fine repast at the Crown, Gervase
and Anne left Oxford at once. Soon they were
in the pleasant meadows that lay all about that
famous city. It was a really glorious morning of the
early summer, with the sun, which day by day had
scorched them, more powerful than ever.</p>

<p>All the forenoon they wandered idly in the fields.
Anne shamed her boy’s apparel by plucking the wild
flowers, gathering a great posy. There seemed hardly
need for a care just then. They had money enough to
carry them through the day and even provide a modest
lodging at nightfall. The grass in which they lay for
long hours was soft, dry, delicious.</p>

<p>Every day that passed strengthened the sense of comradeship
that sustained them. They were all to one another
now. Yet enraptured as they were with their
love, they were never able to forget that they were
proscribed. This glimpse of happiness could only be a
transient thing. Any day, at any hour, Gervase was
likely to fall into the hands of his enemies. But whenever
that dread accident befell them, as sooner or later
it must, they had made their pledge that they would die
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Was there no way of ultimate escape? Each day that
passed had seemed to minister to their love of life.
As they lay in the grass, gazing afar into a heaven so
gorgeous that it filled them with wonder, this longing
to live took hold of them both with a still greater intensity.
Was there no way by which an entirely innocent
man could escape the scaffold?</p>

<p>If only they had a little money to buy a passage on
board ship they might hope to escape across the seas.
Instead of wandering aimlessly from place to place, void
of purpose or design, there was no reason why they
should not make for the coast. Unhappily it was likely
to profit them little when they came there unless they
could provide themselves with some money.</p>

<p>The whole of Gervase’s property had passed into the
hands of the wicked man who had borne false testimony
against him. This man was his uncle, Simon Heriot,
who had succeeded to his personal effects and his estate
in the west of England. These had been confiscated by
the Crown. And in that age it was customary to bestow
the spoils of successful prosecution upon the person or
persons who had procured the conviction of the offender!</p>

<p>Gervase knew that he was the victim of a very wicked
conspiracy. Simon Heriot, cunning, covetous, unspeakably
vile, had laid his plans only too well. So deftly
woven the plot, so wisely chosen its instruments and so
skilful their use of forged proofs and false evidence
that from the first the unlucky Gervase had had little
chance of escape.</p>

<p>He had been caught securely in a trap. The charges
had been laid against him with such diabolical skill that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>it was almost impossible to disprove them. It was in
vain that he had cast himself upon the mercy of the
Queen. Simon Heriot, ignoble as he was at heart, was
a person of some place, and not without consideration
at Court; and he had always been able to mask his
cunning well enough to pass for a high-minded and honorable
man.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that as thus Anne and Gervase
lay together in this golden afternoon, whiling away the
sweet hours that were likely to be so few, this intense
desire for life suddenly found expression in a desperate
resolve. Gervase remembered that the house of Simon
Heriot was but a matter of ten miles or so from the city
of Oxford. And no sooner did this fact occur to him
than he was taken with the idea that it might be possible
to go there and force his uncle to disgorge enough of
his ill-gotten gains to enable Anne and himself to fly
the country.</p>

<p>This bold scheme began to exert a strange fascination
over him. The more thought he gave to it the stronger
grew its hold upon him. Certainly it must prove very
hazardous; it was the wild design of a desperate man,
but it appealed to his mood.</p>

<p>When he came to confide the plan to his comrade she
too approved it. To Anne it opened up a new world
of possibility. The spirit of desperation urging her,
she could see no reason why they should not break into
the house of Simon Heriot in the middle of that night
and seek the means to carry them into safety across the
seas.</p>

<p>Yes, let that be their project! Both saw, however,
that one fatal drawback confronted them. To put such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>a design into execution it was of vital importance that
they should go armed. Thus they now regretted bitterly
that the silver-hilted dagger was no longer in their keeping.</p>

<p>It would be sheer folly to present themselves unarmed
at the house of Simon Heriot. A weapon of some kind
must be procured if the project was to have any chance
of success. Gervase hoped that, with a little luck, he
might be able to barter his flute for a pistol but, unhappily,
by so doing he was likely to deprive them of their
sole means of getting food.</p>

<p>This question of arms was a sore problem. However,
they decided to take a night’s rest before coming
to grips with it in earnest. And they may have been
moved to this wise course by the fact that the house
of Simon Heriot lay out upon the Banbury road, and that
in order to come to it, it would be necessary to retrace
their steps and pass through the town of Oxford.</p>

<p>They bought a bowl apiece of bread and milk of a
kindly farmer’s wife, and this made them a delicious
supper. And for the sum of twopence they were allowed
to lie snug in the barn during the night. And as
they lay thus, discussing the prospects of the strange
hazard upon which they were determined to embark
on the morrow, a new expedient came into the mind of
Gervase.</p>

<p>Ever since their meeting that morning with the man
at the Crown, the thoughts of Gervase strayed continually
toward him. He was not a man to forget.
And now as Gervase lay in the straw in the darkness
considering what must be done, his mind reverted to him
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>All his instincts seemed to tell him that this was an
honest man; moreover a man capable of rare kindness
and instant sympathy; a man whom it would seem possible
for even a couple of hard-pressed fugitives to trust
implicitly.</p>

<p>Yes, let them return to Oxford to the Crown. Let
them seek out this man Shakespeare and tell him as much
of their story as might serve to win his help. As Gervase
lay that night he took a resolve to do this. He
would confide in the man as far as might be necessary.
Perchance this friendly player might approve sufficiently
this hazardous excursion to the house of Simon Heriot
to provide him with a weapon to serve the occasion.</p>

<p>When the morning came, however, this plan seemed
to err a good deal on the side of boldness. In broad
daylight it appeared very far from wise to put such
trust in a man, who, after all, was no more than a total
stranger. Might he not prove, when their story was told
to him, one of those zealots whose devotion to the Queen
would cause him to betray these fugitives from justice?</p>

<p>Still, in spite of all misgiving, Gervase finally determined
to take the risk. Even when every argument had
been urged on the other side of the question, he still felt
that if only they dared to put their faith in this man
who had already shown them such kindness, they would
not appeal in vain for his friendship.</p>

<p>They were about seven miles from Oxford. Having
laid out their remaining store of pence on a frugal
breakfast they trudged forth and in less than two hours
had re-entered the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>R. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE had had a bad
night. Indeed he had hardly slept at all. For
the life of him he could not rid his mind of that
tragic matter in which by fate’s unkindness he had come
to be an unwilling actor.</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted continually to those hapless children
of destiny begging their bread in the hamlets round
Oxford, while their lives hung by a thread; and to the
luckless falconer, man of high instincts and strong tormented
soul, pursuing them relentlessly from place to
place. To this man, moreover, whatever his God and his
conscience might have to say to him, he had been tempted
to lie.</p>

<p>It was now eight o’clock of another glorious summer
morning, and the playwright, looking rather wild-eyed
and haggard, sat on the bench before the door of the
Crown Tavern as he had done the previous day. But now,
instead of holding a mass of papers on his knee he was
seeking solace from a thick brown folio lately from the
press, North’s noble translation of the Lives of Plutarch.</p>

<p>It is strange how events repeat themselves. As on
the previous day at that hour, the player suddenly looked
up from the page and beheld the identical sight upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>which his eyes had then rested. Two nut-brown wanderers
were coming towards him, without a noise of music
this time, but walking hand in hand as if each desired
the sustenance of the other’s courage.</p>

<p>Clearly the player was more than a little startled by the
sight of them. A curious look flitted across his face. It
was almost that of one who has seen a phantom in the
daylight.</p>

<p>The fugitives were quick to notice that the player’s
manner towards them had changed. For all their raggedness
his address was far more considered than it had been
the previous day. In lieu of the air of light, graceful
badinage that had charmed them then was a grave tone
which was not without a note of respectfulness. It was
as if he had learned since last he had seen them that they
were not as they appeared.</p>

<p>“I give you good morrow, sir,” said Gervase.</p>

<p>He kept the humble tone he was wont to use in his
present condition. But now a look of pity came into the
face of the play-actor.</p>

<p>Somehow this entire change in Shakespeare’s manner,
together with the nature of the errand on which they had
come, served to embarrass discourse. On the side of
neither was the lightness and ease of the day before. The
few lame sentences they exchanged seemed further to
increase the difficulty.</p>

<p>But at last said the player suddenly, fixing them both
with his gentle but somber eyes: “Sit here, my friends,
on the bench beside me and tell me a little of yourselves.”</p>

<p>The look of the man was so gravely beguiling that they
were fain to do as he desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>How to begin his strange, his incredible story was now
the problem for Gervase. How much should he tell?
He would take this man fully into his confidence in all
that concerned himself, but in regard to Anne it was another
affair. Indeed, so little did the part she had borne
relate to their present need of this man’s kindness that
Gervase was determined not to mention her unless circumstances
forced him to do so.</p>

<p>It was not easy to begin the story. But, after a moment
of awkwardness in which there was a slow gathering
of all he had of resolution, the young man took the
plunge. “First,” he said, turning his own candid eyes
full upon those of the player, “I would have you to know
that I am about to intrust my life to your hands.”</p>

<p>The player did not speak except that which his eyes
spoke for him.</p>

<p>“My name is Gervase Heriot,” said the young man. “I
am being hunted for my life. I broke out of my prison
three hours before I was to die by the ax.”</p>

<p>“You say you were to die by the ax,” said the player
in a tone so low as hardly to be audible. “For what reason
had you to meet a death so sharp and so shameful?”</p>

<p>“For the reason,” said Gervase, “that a wicked, covetous
man has plotted away my life.”</p>

<p>“Why has he done this?”</p>

<p>“It is merely because he would succeed to that to
which he is not entitled.”</p>

<p>“He has sworn away your life, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has himself borne false testimony. And he
has suborned others as vile as himself to swear a tissue
of lies in order to prove me guilty of a crime of which I
am incapable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Who, pray, is this infamous man?”</p>

<p>“He is my uncle, Simon Heriot.”</p>

<p>“And have you no means of disproving this black conspiracy?”</p>

<p>“None, alas. My Uncle Simon has a very cunning and
subtle mind. His design has been laid very deep. It is
a matter of my unsupported oath against those of specious
knaves who are well found in the trade of swearing away
men’s lives.”</p>

<p>The play-actor grew silent. Not for a moment could
he doubt that Gervase Heriot was innocent of the crime
alleged against him.</p>

<p>It was a grievous story. And one-half of it had not
been told. And he knew it to be all compact of those
elements of which his own mind was formed. It was
such a tale of passion, of poetry, of high romance as the
imagination could not surpass, and the living evidence of
it was before him.</p>

<p>A great desire to help these hapless wanderers surged
in this man’s soul. There were those who were seeking
them far and near; a price was on the head of Heriot;
yet if he were allowed to get clear it might be that a
cruel and shameful penalty would be paid by a man of
stainless honor. All these swift thoughts were thrown
into the alembic of that wonderful mind. But the call
of nature was too strong; his heart went out to these
fugitives in their tragic need. Cost what it may, he
must render any help that lay in his power.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” said the player after a long interval of
silence had passed, “I would fain save your life?”</p>

<p>The young man shook his head gravely. “There’s little
chance of that unless I fly the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“I was thinking so,” said the player.</p>

<p>“But in order to do that I must have some money.
And I will now tell you, sir&mdash;” Gervase sank his voice
very low&mdash;“the manner in which I propose to get it.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the young man divulged the plan he had
formed of visiting his uncle that night.</p>

<p>“Simon Heriot lives in solitude in his gloomy old
manor-house but ten miles off, with only a few decrepit
old servants to take care of him. And my design is to
break into his house in the middle of this very night, to
frighten the wits out of the old knave and make him
disgorge money enough for mine and my brother’s journey
across the seas.”</p>

<p>This hasty and ill-considered scheme, however, did not
appeal to the player. It was too clearly the expedient
of a thoroughly desperate man. There were many reasons
which seemed to make it impracticable. “No, Mr.
Heriot,” he said, “I do not think that way is to be commended.
Let us try to find a better. I will go and think
upon this matter. And in the meantime do you and your
friend remain here and I will send you out some food,
which I have no doubt will come not amiss to you.”</p>

<p>For that surmise at least the player had good warrant.
Soon a stately pigeon pie and a noble flagon of October
ale were laid on the bench before them. And they were
able to eat without misgiving. They had given this man
all their trust, and they had staked their lives on the
fact that he was incapable of betraying it.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>EANWHILE William Shakespeare had gone in
quest of Richard Burbage, that <i>fidus Achates</i>
whose counsel was often invoked by this eager,
but, at times, irresolute spirit. Now, however, Shakespeare
was fully determined to help these ill-starred fugitives
to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p>To render aid that should be in any way effective was
likely to prove a supremely difficult matter. The most
obvious thing to be done was to give them money enough
to enable them to fly the country. Such a course offered
a strong temptation at the moment. But when Shakespeare
came to consider all the consequences that would
follow upon it he put it out of his mind. At the back
of his thoughts was ever the distraught figure of the falconer,
the unhappy man whom he had been compelled to
deceive. If Heriot fled the country Sir John Feversham
would lose his life. No, the hour was not yet for such
an irrevocable step. “But, my friend,” whispered a sinister
voice, too often heard in that overwrought brain,
“you of all men have reason to know that delays are
dangerous!”</p>

<p>Alas he was face to face once more with the old sore
problem&mdash;the problem of how to make up his mind. Once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>more he began to see too much of this grievous matter,
as he saw too much of all things. He owed it to himself
that he should do all in his power to help this unlucky
pair. But no hurt must be done to the falconer,
or to the honorable man his master, who lay in the Tower
in such tragic case.</p>

<p>The playwright, in the toils of an irresolution as great
as he had ever known, went to seek the tragedian in his
favorite place, which was the pleasant garden at the
back of the inn. Fortune favored him, inasmuch that
Richard Burbage was found to be seated on a bench in
the ample shade of a yew tree.</p>

<p>The manager was alone, and with the aid of a pipeful
of the new Indian weed which seldom failed to excite
the wit of his peers, was diligently conning the acting
parts of the new comedy to be given a fortnight hence in
the Queen’s presence.</p>

<p>“William Shakespeare,” said Burbage, looking up as
the shadow of the playwright was cast across the page,
“let these young fools say what they please, but my belief
is you have never written anything choicer.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say that, Dick,” said the playwright,
who spoke, however, as if his thoughts were elsewhere.
“If I could have taken another fortnight to it
perhaps it might have been tolerable, but as it is I am
afraid it is a poor thing.”</p>

<p>“The thing is good enough,” said Burbage robustly.
“It is full of most excellent fantasy. The fact is, some
of these fools have not wit enough for a thing of such
delicacy.”</p>

<p>The playwright shook his head. “Yes, Dick,” he said,
“but a man makes a great mistake when he gets above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>the crowd. There should be something for all the world
and his wife in a comedy.”</p>

<p>Richard Burbage, one of the intellectuals of his day,
was a little shocked by such a banal observation. Had it
been possible for the god of his idolatry to seem less than
himself, he had never been in such imminent danger. But
the true prince must ever be allowed to speak as it
seemed good to him.</p>

<p>“We will thank God that Gloriana has at any rate a
shrewd and seizing mind,” said Richard Burbage, with
enthusiasm. “At least, it will not be above <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>The playwright smiled the little sad smile that was so
often his when others chose to refer to his writings in his
presence. None had ever been able to interpret that
gesture; none ever would, but it was a smile of pain
rather than of happiness.</p>

<p>With a sudden effort of the will the playwright cast
these trivialities out of his thoughts. “Dick,” he said,
“I am come to talk of a matter of more account than this.
I would have you know that our poor young Egyptians
are returned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a murrain on them!” The face of the tragedian
grew startled and discomposed. “Plague take them,” he
said, “I had hoped we had seen the last of them.”</p>

<p>“Poor souls!” said the playwright.</p>

<p>Never had Burbage seen his too-sensitive comrade&mdash;to
whom he had come to stand in the relation of a protective
elder brother&mdash;in such a state of distress. The tragic
story had torn his heart. But the counsel of the tragedian
was sadly discouraging.</p>

<p>“If you will be ruled by me, my friend,” said that sage
and practical man of the world, “you will take precious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>care to keep out of this matter. Let them go their ways.
The times are perilous. And he who touches affairs of
state generally finds it easier to lose his head than to
keep it.”</p>

<p>“You are right there, Dick,” said the playwright, with
an odd light in his eyes. “But better a man should lose
his head than forswear his soul.”</p>

<p>Burbage knew that it was vain to argue with William
Shakespeare in a matter of this kind. There were certain
things in which he was not as other men. For all his
childlike simplicity of character, he had yet the power,
as he had proved many times, to take a line of his own
when occasion called.</p>

<p>“Dick, we must help them,” he said.</p>

<p>“The surest way to do that is to give them money
enough to quit the country,” said the tragedian.</p>

<p>“But what of Sir John Feversham?”</p>

<p>Burbage threw up his hands impatiently. “He concerns
us not,” he said. “And I beseech you, my dear
Will, to give not another thought to him.”</p>

<p>The playwright shook his head. “Nay, my friend,” he
said, “let us not leave a brave and honorable man to
die.”</p>

<p>“To that I would say amen if in any sort we could
avail him.”</p>

<p>“The Queen should learn the truth, I think.”</p>

<p>“How, pray, is she to learn it?”</p>

<p>“On Thursday se’nnight, if this unlucky man still lives,
we must find a way to tell her.”</p>

<p>But Burbage dissented strongly. “It would be madness,
Will, sheer madness for us to breathe a word on
the subject. You know what the times are. And when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
it comes to treason it takes but a very slight thing to undo
the best man alive.”</p>

<p>The playwright had sadly to admit that that was true
enough. But his face showed clearly that he could never
be the slave of mere worldly wisdom. And Burbage
knew it. He might do his best to dissuade his friend
from touching this ill-starred affair, yet from the outset
he had little hope of success. William Shakespeare’s
mind was made up already.</p>

<p>“Come what may, Dick, we must help these poor souls
to the utmost of our capacity.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how will you do it, my master?”</p>

<p>But now that the sympathy of the playwright was fully
engaged he was proof against all scepticism. “First I
would have you give me the key of the tiring-room,” he
said.</p>

<p>“For what purpose, you mad fellow?”</p>

<p>“An uncivil question breeds an uncivil answer. Whatever
the purpose it is nothing to it.”</p>

<p>With many misgivings and great reluctance, Burbage
gave Shakespeare the key of the tiring-room.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Shakespeare returned to the fugitives,
they had finished their meal. They were still
sitting on the bench by the tavern door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Heriot,” said the player, “I have been thinking
very deeply upon your pass. First let me say that I have
a great desire to help you&mdash;and your friend&mdash;to help you
as far as lies in my capacity.”</p>

<p>Gervase thanked him simply.</p>

<p>“But in order to do that,” said the player, “I have to
ask you to yield yourselves entirely into my care. I
would have you do in all things as I desire. It is not
that I can promise your deliverance. It may be that your
pass is beyond my aid or beyond the aid of any man.
But if it is possible for help to be given, that will I do
my utmost to render&mdash;that is, if you are prepared to trust
me to the full.”</p>

<p>Gervase knew that it was his life he was giving into
the care of this man, but not for an instant did he hesitate.</p>

<p>“I trust you to the full,” he said. “And may God requite
you for all that you may do.”</p>

<p>“Alas, it may be but little. But no failure on my part
can make your case more unhappy than it is now. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>one matter at least is imperative. You must find a better
disguise than your present one. Happily, there is the
means at hand. Perhaps you and your friend will come
with me to the players’ tiring-room, which is across the
inn yard?”</p>

<p>Gervase and Anne rose from the bench in order to accompany
the actor.</p>

<p>As they did so, however, their attention was for a moment
diverted. A man, attended by two servants and
whose style was that of a gentleman, rode up to the inn
door. He dismounted within three yards of where the
fugitives stood, and as he was about to enter the tavern,
he turned his bold eyes upon them.</p>

<p>It was hardly more than a glance in passing, and not
more than he would have bestowed on any other pair of
picturesque vagabonds, but brief as it was, there yet
seemed in it a kind of subconscious recognition. The
glance was withdrawn instantly to alight on Shakespeare,
on whom it dwelt long enough for the recognition openly
to declare itself. In this case it was followed by a shrug
of insolent contempt. The newcomer then entered the inn.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Gervase had grown as pale as if he
had seen a ghost. But it was not until he was half-way
across the inn courtyard that he revealed the cause of
his emotion.</p>

<p>“Did you, by any chance, recognize that fellow?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said Shakespeare. “He is a man well
known about the Court, a certain Sir Robert Grisewood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Robert Grisewood,” said Gervase. “And it
was he, at the instance of my Uncle Simon, who swore
away my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>The player stopped abruptly in the middle of the inn
yard, an exclamation upon his lips.</p>

<p>“That’s undoubtedly the man,” said Gervase, “by all
that’s unlucky. Or may be it is not unlucky, since Providence
works in ways so dark and strange.”</p>

<p>“Wherein I fully agree,” said the player. “And it may
be that even in this Providence is working for us in a
mysterious way. But I hope this man did not know you.”</p>

<p>“I think he did not,” said Gervase. “His eye would
have dwelt longer if he had. But you he certainly recognized;
moreover, he did not seem to approve you.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare smiled.</p>

<p>“He is one of a hundred bullies who ruffle it about
the Court. When they are not cringing before their betters,
they are generally browbeating those whom they are
pleased to consider their inferiors.”</p>

<p>“He is a very dangerous man,” said Gervase, “And
if I cross his path, my life will not be worth an hour’s
purchase.”</p>

<p>“Well, the tiring-room is not far away,” said the player.
“And there, I think, we can find you a disguise that will
tax the wit of Sir Robert to penetrate.”</p>

<p>The inn was a large, rectangular building, provided
with galleries which overlooked the spacious courtyard.
It was in this that the Lord Chamberlain’s servants had
arranged to give the first of their performances that afternoon.
The room to which the actor now led Anne and
Gervase opened on to one of these galleries, at the extreme
end of the yard.</p>

<p>Here were all sorts of stage properties. Not only was
there a number of costumes, but also there were wigs,
powder and cosmetics and other trappings of the theater.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>Much searching among this apparel was necessary before
clothes could be found which Shakespeare deemed suitable
for Gervase and Anne. Many of these costumes
were very rich; and at last an elegant suit of boy’s clothes
was found for Anne. She went into a room adjoining to
put it on. And, in the meantime, Gervase was provided
with a much more elaborate disguise.</p>

<p>First, he was put into a suit of plain black velvet,
modest in appearance, but excellent in quality, very similar
to the player’s own. Then his eyes were carefully
darkened and lines painted under them to add to his
years. A pair of fine moustachios was fixed to his upper
lip and a short beard to his chin. Finally, he was accommodated
with a hat with a plume, a ruff for the neck,
and at his own request, a very serviceable sword, which
he buckled to his waist with a feeling of keen satisfaction.</p>

<p>The transformation Gervase had undergone was so
complete, that when Anne returned wearing her own excellent
suit, which fitted her admirably except that it was
a little loose in the shoulders, she did not know him.</p>

<p>“Allow me to present Signor Bandinello,” said the
player. “A famous music master from Italy.”</p>

<p>Anne, in the surprise of the moment, so far forgot her
own disguise as to curtsy. Whereupon, greatly to her
discomfiture, Gervase and the player fairly shouted with
laughter.</p>

<p>Anne’s clothes really became her very well indeed.
They could hardly have fitted her slender form better
had they been made for her. She, too, was given a ruff
for her neck, a hat with a plume and a dagger to wear
at her waist. Thus accomplished, she made a particularly
handsome and modish boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Gervase’s disguise, which had added at least thirty
years to his age, was so complete, that the player had no
fear that he would be recognized. Accordingly, he led
him boldly into the inn and duly presented him to Burbage,
Kemp and one or two other members of the company
as a celebrated musician who had consented to take
charge of the music at Richmond on Tuesday week.
Anne was introduced as his son. And it was suggested
that Arrigo, a name bestowed upon her by the playwright
on the spur of the moment, should understudy Parflete
for the character of <i>Rosalind</i>. Indeed, the author of the
new comedy seemed to be clearly of opinion that the
young Signor Arrigo had been designed expressly by
nature to play that delicate and exacting rôle.</p>

<p>Burbage guessed at once who Signor Bandinello and
Arrigo his son really were. But he was far too loyal,
even if he had not been too astute, to share his knowledge
with the other members of the company. These, to be
sure, were a little surprised at such an unexpected addition
to their number. Yet not for a moment did they
suspect the truth.</p>

<p>Thus, for the time being, a very remarkable change
was wrought in the fortunes of Gervase and Anne. No
longer need they seek a roof or a meal. No longer need
they go footsore and hungry. Providence once more had
taken them into its care. It was true that, in some ways,
they had added threefold to their dangers. They had
given their lives into the keeping of a man of whom they
knew little or nothing. But having burnt their boats,
they had the courage wholeheartedly to embrace this new
way of life.</p>

<p>They entered into the doings of these new friends with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>spirit and amenity. And Shakespeare sustained the deception
with great tact and wit. Moreover, Gervase and
Anne were ever ready to second him in all his inventions
and contrivances. Indeed, Gervase, who was familiar
with Italy, was able to counterfeit a slight accent, which
heightened the illusion of his broken English; while Anne,
although not a little shy, bore herself with a modest grace,
that made the young Signor Arrigo extremely popular
with all the members of the Company.</p>

<p>It chanced, besides, that when these two Italians had
made their appearance but a few hours among the Lord
Chamberlain’s servants, an incident occurred which added
greatly to their prestige.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the chief members of the
Company, who were lodged at the Crown Tavern, which
was reckoned much the best in Oxford, should dine together
at noon in the large parlor. This would allow
plenty of time against the performance of “The Merchant
of Venice,” which was to be given in the inn courtyard at
two o’clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>The players had sat down to their meal. Shakespeare,
at the head of the long table in the center of the room,
was carving a sirloin with the dexterity of one who had
been a butcher’s apprentice in his youth. Burbage, at
the foot of the table, was dealing with a couple of roast
fowls with an air of manly conviction. Anne had already
been given a wing, and William Kemp, that famous
comedian, was cutting a piece of ham to accompany
it, with a flourish of wit as well as of knife, when the
door of the dining-parlor was flung open suddenly. A
man entered rudely and roughly with a clank of sword
and spur. He had not even the grace to remove his hat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>One glance he cast round the room, saw no place was
set for him, and then called loudly for the landlord.</p>

<p>“The place is full of these stinking play-actors!” he
cried out. “The best inn in Oxford is now the worst.
These mimes have taken all the best rooms, they infest
the place like vermin. They are sticking up a filthy stage
upon filthy trestles in the middle of the courtyard, so
that a man hasn’t even room to water his horse, and now,
by God’s blood, they crowd their betters out of the dining-parlor!”</p>

<p>The man was Sir Robert Grisewood, whom Shakespeare
and Gervase had seen already. He was an insolent
bully, of a type common in that day; a man of
brutal and dangerous character, who lived by his wits and
his sword, with just enough surface manners when it
suited him to pass muster with those with whom he
wished to consort, but whose chief pleasure was to ruffle
it through the world and take the wall of those less well
placed than himself.</p>

<p>This morning, however, Sir Robert was a little out of
his reckoning. The man with the mild face who was
carving the sirloin paused to look at him. And if ever
a high scorn was expressed in the human countenance,
it was here to be seen.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean you as well as the rest, you paper-faced
potboy,” said Grisewood, having failed to stare him down.
“Go back to your filthy playhouse in the stews, and don’t
come among your betters until they send for you, unless
you want to get your nose pulled.”</p>

<p>The coarse bully had drunk a cup of wine too much
already that morning. He was bitterly angry, besides,
that his favorite chamber overlooking the garden was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>the occupation of this mean fellow, who lived by the
public favor instead of by cheating at cards. With a
string of oaths, he advanced upon Shakespeare and shook
a fist in his face.</p>

<p>In an instant, several of the players had risen to their
feet. But foremost was Burbage. He laid down his
knife, and then, white with anger, he came over very
deliberately to where the man stood and touched him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Have a care, my friend,” he said. “Keep a civil tongue
in your head. And lay but a finger on that man, and
you go into the horse-trough.”</p>

<p>“But you go to perdition first, you calf-livered merry-andrew.”</p>

<p>Grisewood had swung round with a face of fury. He
drew his sword. But in almost the same moment Heriot,
who had risen with the rest, had drawn his.</p>

<p>Grisewood had not meant to make use of his weapon.
Yet in the next instant, and quite without expecting it, he
was having to use it for dear life.</p>

<p>Gervase at once struck up the weapon with his own
and then engaged it. Grisewood was a man of formidable
reputation. More than one good life had paid the
toll of his exceptional skill. His adversary was aware
of this. But he also was an accomplished swordsman.
Moreover, an intense and furious hatred had armed him
suddenly. This was the man who had sworn away his
life.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE sound of the clashing steel, of chairs overturning,
of shouting and scuffling, brought John
Davenant into the room. The sight that met him
turned him sick. A man of whom he went in mortal fear
was defending himself as best he could from the furious
lunges of a tall, elderly foreigner, who yet used his sword
with all a young man’s address and agility.</p>

<p>“Oh, stop ’em, for the love of God!” cried John Davenant.</p>

<p>But the players knew better than to intervene. The
bully was being pressed so close and with such a bitter
animosity, that for any man to have attempted such a
task had been highly dangerous. Also they knew the
man for what he was. And now was as fair a chance
as was ever likely to offer for him to pay his dues.</p>

<p>The Italian music master was pressing Grisewood at the
point of his weapon all over the room. But only one of
those present was aware that he had murder in his heart.
And this was the man who knew what was the real issue
between them. That agile mind, moreover, had the
power to look swiftly ahead. In an instant, it had
grasped the full significance of that which was happening
and of the grave danger that threatened.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>
<p>In the stress of the moment, Shakespeare threw discretion
to the wind. He approached far nearer than was
wise to the combatants. Their breaths were coming in
fierce, low grunts. Sweat was on their white faces. Murder
was in the eyes of both.</p>

<p>Utterly heedless of his peril, Shakespeare went to the
side of Gervase.</p>

<p>“Have a care,” he said. “For God’s sake don’t kill
him.”</p>

<p>Well it was that Gervase was of those who can keep a
hold upon themselves, even when a savage blood-lust
has them in its toils. Desperately as he was fighting, he
heard the words of his friend, and well he understood
them. But he was out to kill. With a contained rage
that was terrible, he meant to pierce that strong and
resourceful guard, and then should the man pay the
penalty of his crimes.</p>

<p>Grisewood was not a coward. He was among the
coarsest and most brutal of his kind in a coarse and
brutal age. His life had been ignoble, but he was a
man, in any circumstances, to sell it dearly. Yet as this
tall and furious fellow drove him all over the room, he
felt that now his hour was come.</p>

<p>This would have been the case without a doubt, had
not Gervase realized the importance of the player’s warning.
He must lay aside his revenge for a season. This
man was a link in the slender chain that one day might
save him. But he was determined that the ruffian should
not go scot free. By sheer vigor, he drove Grisewood
finally against the wall. And once there, he broke down
the man’s guard and drove the point of his sword
through his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>It was the end of the fight. Grisewood was totally disabled.
Suffering great pain and bleeding fiercely and
streaming curses, he was glad enough to have his hurt
attended to and then, under a chirurgeon’s advice, to be
put to bed by John Davenant.</p>

<p>From that hour, the Italian music master was a hero in
the sight of the Lord Chamberlain’s servants. To be
sure, his son, Arrigo, disgraced himself utterly by going
off into a dead faint as soon as the fight was over, and although
such behavior was felt perhaps to be ultra-Italian,
it did not lessen his popularity among his new comrades.</p>

<p>Two o’clock that afternoon was the hour fixed for the
Lord Chamberlain’s players to give their first performance
in Oxford. Much of the morning had been spent in
erecting a stage in the center of the spacious courtyard
of the Crown. It seemed that the visit of this famous
company had given rise to grave controversy. Shakespeare
had applied for leave to play three pieces in the
large hall of Balliol College, or of some other convenient
place within the precincts of the University. The question
was referred to the Vice Chancellor. “Yes,” said
that worthy, “after giving the matter anxious consideration,
as we have a favorable report from London touching
your band of comedians, and we learn that her Grace
the Queen has approved them on divers occasions, the
University will accede to your request, provided the
pieces are given in their original Greek or Latin.”</p>

<p>Upon this, the playwright made the modest rejoinder
that, much as he regretted the circumstances, it was, in
point of fact, impossible to play the three pieces in either
of those chaste tongues, since he himself had written
them in the vulgar English language, which unfortunately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>was the only tongue with which he could claim an acquaintance,
and that a very imperfect one. Such a statement
was very shocking to the University. The permission
was at once withheld, but in language of great
politeness and dignity. “We do not well understand,” it
said in effect, “how one who is not even a member of
this University or of the sister foundation of Cambridge,
who, we are credibly informed, is a mere hackney writer
for the theaters, and who, we are further informed, is a
little better than one of the illiterate, can prefer such a
request.”</p>

<p>After this rebuff, the playwright, quite undaunted, applied
to the city authorities for permission to use the
Town Hall. In the meantime, however, the news had
been carried to the bench of aldermen that the University
had rebuked this importunate fellow. And if the vulgar
English tongue was beneath the dignity of the Gown, how
much more was it beneath the dignity of the Town, which
had a reputation to maintain and so much less upon which
to maintain it. “No, sir,” said the bench of aldermen,
“we would have you to know that that which is not
deemed worthy for only a part or moiety of this fair
city, is deemed still less so for the whole of it.”</p>

<p>Thus there was nothing left for the poor playwright to
do but to seek permission of honest John Davenant, mine
host of the Crown, to set up trestles and boards and rig
up a curtain in the middle of his large inn yard. And
John Davenant, having less in the way of learning than
the Gown and less in the way of dignity than the Town,
and being promised, moreover, a full ten percentum of
the takings at each performance, was nowise averse from
such a proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>The play to be given that afternoon was “The Merchant
of Venice,” a pleasant comedy that had already been
played several times with success in Shoreditch. The
author of the piece had not to play in it himself, a contingency
for which he expressed himself devoutly thankful.
“A bad play is doubly damned,” he said, “if the author
himself has to preen and strut in it.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, the more congenial and not less onerous
rôle was to be his of sitting at the receipt of custom.
But his friend, Richard Burbage, had for his sins to play
the Jew. And the famous tragedian was fain to declare
that the playwright as usual had got the best of the bargain,
inasmuch that it was far easier to play the Jew in
the box-office than it was upon the boards.</p>

<p>These players were a high-spirited, light-hearted, genial
crew. The incident in which they had been concerned
in nowise affected their gaiety. They lived in and for
the moment; they took life as it came to them; theirs was
the sovereign faculty of being able to lay care aside.
They were prone to set all sorts of tricks upon one another,
and to crack jokes and tell tales at one another’s
expense. They seemed to have no particular respect for
anybody, not even for Shakespeare himself, but Anne
and Gervase noticed that only one man in all that merry,
careless company ever ventured to break a lance with
him.</p>

<p>Richard Burbage was the man in question. The tragedian
was a short, powerfully-made man, with a solemn
face of much good-humor and an organ-like voice that
was both rich and deep. When the playwright and his
friend crossed swords, which they did pretty frequently,
the whole table would cease to ply knife and spoon in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>order that it might attend the combat. These duellos,
to be sure, were carried off in the highest style of pleasantry,
but the play was very keen while it lasted.</p>

<p>The dramatist sat at one end of the long table, and his
trusty henchman at the other.</p>

<p>“They do tell me,” said the tragedian, in his slow,
rolling speech, and bestowing a wink on those that were
near him, “that this plaguy piece we have all got to play
in for our sins this plaguy afternoon is the work of a
certain court gallant by the name of William Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>At this, the dramatist at the other end of the table
laid down his knife very deliberately, and after gazing
around as if in search of a thing he could not see, said,
“I wonder whence that growl proceeds. I do believe
there is a dog in the room. Young Parflete”&mdash;this to the
youngest and smallest member of the company&mdash;“young
Parflete, I will thank you to pitch it out with your foot
behind it.”</p>

<p>“A friend,” proceeded the tragedian, in a very audible
whisper for all that he spoke behind his hand, “of the
Queen’s most gracious majesty. This is no reflection
upon the Queen, still it must have been a sore trial to
her friendship when such a burden was laid upon it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a dog,” said the dramatist, very gravely.
“One of those brindled, flop-eared, yellow-coated, squab-bellied
mongrels by the sound of it. It is the kind of
dog that is only fit for a blind pedlar to trundle at the
end of a string. Hi, Thomas!”&mdash;addressing a servant
who had entered with a dish&mdash;“there is a dog in the
room.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it, sir,” said the servant, looking round.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, but there is, I tell you. One of those squat brutes
all body and no legs. One of those half-begotten starvelings
that lies all day by the hob and whines all night
to the moon.”</p>

<p>“I see no dog, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked under the table, Thomas?”</p>

<p>Thomas looked under the table, but still could see no
dog.</p>

<p>“But I heard it, man, I tell you. There is no mistaking
such a voice as that.”</p>

<p>“There is no dog here, sir,” the servant assured him,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Upon your oath, there is no dog?”</p>

<p>“No dog, sir, upon my oath.”</p>

<p>“Then the sound must proceed,” said the playwright,
“from that queer, rude fellow who sits at the foot of
the table there, of whom I am credibly informed that,
since he retired from the theater, he gains a precarious
livelihood by training bloodhounds to sing like canaries.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE inn courtyard was seething with excitement
long before the play began. Handbills had been
distributed in the town for some days past, and
notices of the performance had been set up in prominent
places.</p>

<p>A love of the drama, amounting almost to a passion,
had taken hold of all classes. From the Queen in her
palace to the village idler in his hedge alehouse, provided
he could raise a penny to buy standing room in the yard
of the Crown Tavern, all took the keenest delight in the
new and wonderful drama that was rising in their midst.
Every phase of these strong and moving plays was followed
with a breathless excitement. They were given
without scenery or the thousand and one devices that
help to sustain illusion in a modern theater. There was
literally nothing between the play and the audience, not
even the lure of sex, since all the women’s parts were
played by boys, but the success of these performances
was extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Lord Chamberlain’s men were known to be a famous
company. Their headquarters were the Globe Theatre,
the playhouse that had been built recently on the
Bankside in Southwark. But as their provincial tours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>were numerous, their reputation had spread up and down
the country. They were already known as the best players
of the time, and the plays in which they appeared
were held to be the strongest.</p>

<p>The stage had been set up at the end of the inn yard.
Standing room could be had for a penny on the cobblestones
of the yard itself, but the best and most comfortable
places were those in the galleries, which ran
round three sides of it and commanded a full view of
the stage. A shilling was the charge for places here.
But the most coveted place of all was a stool on the stage,
which was reserved for a few persons of distinction.</p>

<p>Among those who had been given a seat on the stage
this afternoon, were three who had come in a spirit of
scepticism. They were men of dignified and authoritative
bearing, keenly alive, no doubt, to their condescension
in gracing the proceedings with their presence.
Much discussion had taken place among these personages
as to the importunity which had sought to gain the sanction
of the university for the play about to be given, also
for two others by the same uneducated hand.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the subject would not have
been thought worthy of discussion in such exalted circles,
would in fact have been dismissed as a matter of
not the least consequence, had it not been that quite recently
that august man, the Dean of Christ Church College,
had enjoyed the privilege of eating with Gloriana in
her palace at Greenwich. And she had spoken in his
hearing with high approval of the man Shakespeare, and
was even pleasantly anticipating his new interlude, which
was to be given for the first time in her presence on some
fine summer’s afternoon in Richmond Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>In Ascalon they never referred to the fact that Gloriana,
with all her merits, was an unlettered woman, whose
taste was robust. For a queen is a queen even in the eyes
of a Dean of Christ Church College; and when this
curious, little bald man in a furred gown confided to
the Master of Balliol, his distinguished coadjutor, that
this mime whose name he forgot was undoubtedly <i>persona
gratissima</i> in royal palaces, they agreed that while such
clowning could receive no sanction from the University,
it would hardly be seemly in the circumstances to drive
the mummers out of the town.</p>

<p>It happened, at that time, that the Master of Balliol
had staying with him in college a young man of promise,
Mr. Francis Bacon by name, who knew his way about
the Court. And when the Dean chanced to mention that
this man, whose name he had forgotten, desired to perform
three of his interludes within the precincts of that
ancient home of learning and that the Queen approved
him mightily, Mr. Francis Bacon, who even at that time
had taken all knowledge for his province, exclaimed,
“By God, it must be that plaguy fellow, Shakescene, that
all the Court is mad about!”</p>

<p>“Shakescene is the man’s name, undoubtedly,” said the
eminent divine, gravely. “An importunate Shakescene,
moreover, who would play three of his rustical interludes
within the precincts of this old foundation.”</p>

<p>“Importunate enough, I grant you,” said Mr. Francis,
taking snuff with a great air. “Wat Raleigh tells me the
numskull comes to Court in a barred cloak and affects
the style of a gentleman. However&mdash;fine feathers make
not fine birds. But why not let the rogue play his interludes,
eh, Master? How say you, Mr. Dean? And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>we will go ourselves and witness ’em. I have long sought
the opportunity to watch one of the performances of this
ripe scholar.”</p>

<p>“The rogue shall perform in the town, Mr. Francis,”
said the Dean of Christ Church, “if perform he must,
but not, I promise you, within the precincts of this old
and honorable foundation.”</p>

<p>“I doubt not he would perform still better at the whipping
post, where such knaves more truly belong,” said
the Master of Balliol, taking a prodigious pinch of snuff
from the box of the Dean. “But as you say, Francis,
let the rogue set up his booth in the city, and thither
we will repair of an afternoon. We can then judge for
ourselves what it is that the taste of Gloriana the peerless
approves.”</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Gervase and Anne, who had been
stowed away in a corner of the gallery out of the sight
of the multitude, were able to gaze directly down upon
these three grave and serious gentlemen, who were seated
upon the stage itself.</p>

<p>Grave and serious they might be. Yet as they decked
the proscenium, their demeanor was spiced with not a
little levity. Not only their surroundings, but the whole
of that which was taking place, seemed to provide food
for their sly mirth.</p>

<p>Gervase had marked one of the three in particular immediately
upon his entrance.</p>

<p>“I know that man,” he whispered to Anne. “Yes, the
fellow in the feathered bonnet and the blue cloak. He is
always about the Court. Sit close, dear soul. He’s got
the eye of a hawk, but, thank God, he won’t look to see
me like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Francis Bacon had eyes for nothing save
the comedy that was being performed for his benefit.
Greatly condescending, the future Lord Chancellor had
come in the company of two learned pundits with no better
intention than to deride the piece and its author.</p>

<p>Now there never was yet a critic since the world began
who accosts an author in such a mood who has the
least difficulty in making good his intention. If the man
has wit, he lacks propriety. If he has invention, he lacks
art. If his writing is marvelously alive, it is of course
barbarous. If it is poetical, it is not true to nature. If
it should happen to be true to nature, the whole performance
is so flat, stale and mediocre as to be unworthy
of the pains spent upon it. Whichever way the
author turns, the critic is ready for him. Every merit
he possesses serves as a fresh weapon to assail him.</p>

<p>Had these gentlemen had the good fortune to live two
hundred years later, when the reputation of the author
was already secure, they would have been among the
first to make him the standard of comparison. It would
have then been quite legitimate to admire “The Merchant
of Venice,” and even to have taken credit for doing so.
But how was it possible for men of polite learning to
treat seriously the production of a shabby fellow who took
your half-crown at the entrance to the inn yard?</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of themselves, Mr. Francis Bacon and his
two august friends were not a little diverted by the briskness
of the piece. But any entertainment there was to
be derived from it had, of course, to be laid to the door
of the actors. The acting was undoubtedly excellent,
but the less said of the play, the better.</p>

<p>Still, notwithstanding the fact that the opinion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>critics who graced the proscenium was not very favorable,
all the rest of the house appeared mightily to approve the
play. The afternoon had turned wet and there was
no roof to the inn yard, but those who were packed in
it so closely that they could hardly breathe, followed the
whole of the piece with ever-growing excitement. They
roared with delight at its humors. <i>Portia</i>, who was
played by young Parflete, enchanted them. They execrated
the Jew, yet Richard Burbage, as became the great
actor he was, invested his defeat with a pathetic dignity
that almost drew their tears.</p>

<p>“Ha! now, that is the man,” said Mr. Francis Bacon.
“I ask you, what had the play been without such incomparable
acting?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed!” said the learned doctors.</p>

<p>“I must make that fellow my compliments upon his
performance,” said the Master of Balliol College.</p>

<p>And a few minutes afterwards, when the delighted audience
was streaming out of the yard, these great men
condescended to approach the tragedian and express their
approval.</p>

<p>“Fain would I make you my compliments, sir,” said
Mr. Francis Bacon, in his highest style, in order to impress
the person he addressed, “upon the inimitable art
you have used this afternoon. The performance would
have been barren enough without it. Never have I seen
acting so choice lavished on a play so inferior.”</p>

<p>The tragedian looked very doubtfully at Mr. Francis
Bacon.</p>

<p>“By your leave, sir,” he said, “I would not have you
exalt me at the expense o’ the piece.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, sir, your modesty does you honor,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>the Master of Balliol College. “But your genius, if I
may so express myself, is deserving of something far
better than the clumsy work of this rude journeyman.”</p>

<p>The tragedian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nor would I have you exalt me at the expense of the
writer,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend, you are too modest,” interposed the
Dean of Christ Church in an amiable manner.</p>

<p>“If it is the part of modesty,” said the tragedian
bluntly, “to decline to be praised by the ignorant, then I
grant you that modest I may be. Because I would have
you to know, you learned doctors in your furred gowns,
that the play you have just witnessed is by the first dramatic
author of this age or of any other.”</p>

<p>The three gentlemen were unable to repress a polite
snigger.</p>

<p>“What!” said the Master of Balliol College, “that <i>odd</i>-looking
fellow with the beard who sat in the pay box and
bit my half-crown as if he feared it was a counterfeit?”</p>

<p>“The same, sir,” said Burbage. “And if you can put
a counterfeit upon him, you are an abler man than I have
yet cause to consider you.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, sir,” said the Master of Balliol College,
with an air of pained dignity. “But, pray, convey my
compliments to your Johannes Factotum, and inform him
that if he will give his days and nights diligently to the
study of Aristotle, he may, by the time he is a very old
man, be able to produce a passable play without doing
grave violence to the dramatic unities.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be kind enough, sir,” said the tragedian,
“to pay William Shakespeare your own compliments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
for here he comes staggering under the receipts
of the performance.”</p>

<p>The playwright, his face beaming with satisfaction,
came towards them.</p>

<p>“We had near ten pound in the yard, Dick,” he said,
with a frank disregard of all things except the business
in hand. “That is, unless a half-crown that a little half-faced,
chapt-shot, under-hung mouse of a fellow in a
furred gown put upon me is a counterfeit. And I am
sore afraid it is, unless my pooh old teeth have lost
their integrity. Do you try it, Dick.”</p>

<p>The playwright handed the dubious coin to the tragedian.</p>

<p>“I presume you refer to my half-crown, sir?” said the
Master of Balliol College, with great dignity.</p>

<p>“I hope, sir, I may presume to refer to it as your half-crown,”
said Mr. William Shakespeare, “if my friend
Shylock here adjudges it to be one. How now, Usurer,
what say you?”</p>

<p>“If that is a half-crown,” said the tragedian, who had
already bitten the coin nearly through, “I’ll never be
paid in anything but five shilling pieces as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“But I protest, sir,” said the Master of Balliol College,
warmly, “that coin was paid to me last evening by my
much-honored friend here, Mr. Francis Bacon, over a
game of primero.”</p>

<p>“The more shame to Mr. Francis Bacon, then,” said
the tragedian, “that he should use such a coin for such a
purpose in such a company.”</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Bacon examined for himself the dubious
currency.</p>

<p>“It cannot be the one I gave you, Master,” he said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>as soon as he was able to assure himself that the coin
was false.</p>

<p>“Certainly it is, Francis,” said the Master of Balliol
College, with a pained air.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe it, Master. However&mdash;” Mr. Francis
put the coin in his pocket with the quiet dignity of one
who realizes the force of the old adage, <i>noblesse oblige</i>:
which, in plain English, may be taken to mean that it
ill becomes gentlemen to argue among themselves in the
presence of the commonalty. “However, as I was saying,
Master, to return to Aristotle, that much-overrated
sciolist, I do most cordially approve your critical acumen
when you say that if our friend Master Shakescene&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Master Shakespeare,” interposed the tragedian,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“I beg his pardon. If our friend, Master Shakespeare,
here would study the drama <i>ad hoc</i>, and give his days
and nights to that matchless work, the “Ars Poetica,” of
Aristotle, there is indeed no reason why, in the process of
nature and always under the courtesy of providence, he
should not one day produce a work of the imagination
that pays some little regard to the laws that govern such
quaint abortions of the human mind.”</p>

<p>Mr. William Shakespeare listened with an air of grave
courtesy to this sage counsel. Like all men of parts, he
was at heart a very humble man, with a deep reverence
for true learning. It was too late in the day for him to
hope to acquire it. He had never known the want of wit,
yet in his mind was ever the thought of how much better
his plays would have been could he have fashioned his
rude verses after the manner of the ancients.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Lord Chamberlain’s servants were in the highest
spirits. The remarkable success of their first
performance in the famous city of Oxford had
pleased them greatly. They had been put upon their
mettle by their cold reception at the hands of town and
gown. Seldom had they acted even one of their most
effective plays with such force and sincerity.</p>

<p>Long before the play was at an end, a triumph was
assured. They had a proud sense of having struck a
shrewd blow to prejudice. Those in the thronged galleries
and the close-packed press all about the stage had
shouted themselves hoarse. The author of the play, who
had a share in the profits of the company, lost no time
in turning the flood tide of popular favor to account.
His mind was a remarkable blend of business acumen
and high poetic genius. He arranged at once that
the Lord Chamberlain’s servants should extend their
visit by three days, in order that other of his pieces
might be given. And among these was to be a first
performance of the new, pleasant, conceited comedy
of “As You Like It,” which in the following week
was to be given at Richmond Palace in the Queen’s
presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>There is nothing like a sense of success to uplift the
heart. When a man goes from triumph to triumph, his
wit becomes more nimble, his fancy expands, his talent
runs the more free. And at this time, all these happy
conditions were fulfilled in the career of William Shakespeare.
He was at the zenith of his mental and physical
power. All things to which he turned his hand ministered
to his fame and affluence.</p>

<p>The unlucky Gervase Heriot, lying in the shadow of
a peril that would have wrecked the strongest will, had
come upon this man in an hour when nothing seemed
beyond the scope of his invention. The tragic history of
this young man, and of the noble girl who had forfeited
all in order to save his life, had wrought deeply upon
the player’s pity.</p>

<p>Shakespeare had resolved to help the fugitives to the
utmost of his power. Such a decision in circumstances of
such grave peril and difficulty could only have sprung
from the large generosity of a great nature. He had all
to lose by mingling in the affairs of one in this grim pass.
Nothing could be more perilous than to help a convicted
traitor to escape his doom, but in spite of the
solemn warnings and even the earnest prayers of his
devoted friend, Burbage, the playwright’s mind was now
set upon this task.</p>

<p>It was easier, however, to form this resolve than to
give it practical expression. But the outcome of much
anxious thought upon the matter was to make one fact
clear. If the life of Heriot was not to be spared at the
expense of a man as blameless as himself, an appeal must
be made to the Queen. And in order to do that with the
smallest hope of success, the young man must be able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>adduce a strong proof of his innocence and, at the same
time, engage the Queen’s sympathy.</p>

<p>There lay the crux of the whole matter. And as soon
as this conclusion had been reached, the keenly practical
mind of the playwright began to grapple with this sore
problem. At first, it seemed hopeless to do anything.
There appeared to be no means of obtaining the all-important
proof of Gervase Heriot’s innocence, without
which it would be the height of imprudence to bring the
matter to the notice of the Queen. For none knew better
than William Shakespeare, that she was a woman of
harsh and imperious temper.</p>

<p>Thus was it beyond all things necessary that a proof
of Heriot’s innocence should be found. The playwright
sat late that evening in a secluded corner of the inn
parlor, anxiously discussing with “Signor Bandinello”
every aspect of his unhappy case. It was true that he
deemed it wise to withhold all mention of the falconer’s
visit and the sinister news he had brought. Shakespeare
was convinced that such information had only to come
to the ears of Gervase Heriot for the fugitive to give
himself up at once. This was not the kind of man to
allow another to suffer in his place.</p>

<p>Many were the questions with which the player plied
Gervase, in the hope of finding some way out of this
tragic coil. The natural starting point of this search for
a means of escape was the presence in that inn of the man
Grisewood. In a sense, it would almost seem that the
hand of providence lurked in such a coincidence. But
how to turn it to account, that was the problem.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to make him play false his ignoble
partner, the man Simon Heriot? A very little reflection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>convinced Shakespeare that any such hope was vain. To
begin with, nothing was less likely than that Grisewood
would run the risk of putting his neck in a noose by confessing
the truth; again, having very recently experienced
the thrust of the sword of “the Italian music master,” he
had now the best of reasons for nursing an implacable
hatred against the man whose life he had sworn away.</p>

<p>From a consideration of the man lying upstairs sick
with the pain of an ugly wound, it was a natural transition
to the sole author and inspirer of the whole tragic business.
The house of Simon Heriot was but ten miles
away. And if hope of any kind was to be derived from
the nearness of the chief actors in the sordid drama, it
seemed to lie in this fact.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the pass of Sir John Feversham, the
playwright was too wise a man to approve the wild
scheme that Gervase had formed, which indeed was the
cause of his return to Oxford. The risk would be great,
the gain slight and uncertain. But indirectly, it was Gervase’s
crude plan which now set the subtle brain to work.
Many were the questions Shakespeare asked touching
the character, the habits, the mode of life of Simon
Heriot.</p>

<p>Among other things he learned was that this man was
of a morbid imagination, holding himself aloof from his
kind. Of late, he had mixed but little in the world. It
was even thought by some that his mind had at last
turned against itself, and that it had begun to show signs
of a failing sanity.</p>

<p>It was not at first that the significance of these things
revealed themselves to the playwright. It was not at first
that he realized the use to which they might be put. Unconsciously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
however, they were stored in his brain
against the time they should be cast into the crucible of
its invention.</p>

<p>Shakespeare learned much that evening from his talk
with Gervase Heriot. Keen as had been his pity for him
from the moment he had first heard his tragic history,
their present intercourse deepened it rather than made it
less. He was quick to recognize the depth and the valor
of this young man’s soul, and that of the great-hearted
girl who had dared all to save him from the scaffold.
Theirs was a wonderful story, all compact of the very
life-blood of drama. And when Shakespeare was told
very simply that upon the arrival of that hour in which
they could no longer hope to put off their foes, they had
a plan whereby they might die together, such a declaration
had the power to thrill the heart of one who spent
his life in the devising of plays.</p>

<p>Long they talked together. On the one side was an
intense sympathy, a fervent pity; on the other, a clear and
manful courage that was not afraid to trust its instincts.
And in this case those instincts were to put implicit faith
in this stranger by the wayside, the power of whose personality
was so compelling.</p>

<p>It happened about midnight, while Gervase and the
player still talked together, that a traveler came into the
inn parlor. Shakespeare saw at once that it was the
falconer returned weary and despondent from his quest.
The man came over to where they sat. His face and
bearing were very tragic.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to have seen anything of those
gypsies I spoke to you about?” he said to the player.</p>

<p>Shakespeare shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“I have lost all track of them now,” said the falconer.
“My belief is, they are somewhere in Oxford. At least,
they were last seen outside this inn. And, in any case, I
can go no farther to-night.”</p>

<p>“What gypsies are you seeking, friend?” asked Gervase.</p>

<p>The falconer and he had only seen each other once, and
then only for a moment. Thus neither knew who the
other was. The falconer gave a brief description of those
whom he sought, but it was explicit enough to tell Gervase
that Anne and himself were the objects of his quest.</p>

<p>“What might you be wanting with them?” asked
Gervase.</p>

<p>“It is a long story,” said the falconer. “I am too weary
to tell it to-night. But to-morrow, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, he went out of the room. Shakespeare
was much relieved to see him go. But the man’s inopportune
return had much increased the difficulties of the
situation.</p>

<p>“I have seen that man before,” said Gervase, “yet, for
my life, I cannot think where. And I have not the least
doubt that it is my brother and I he is seeking. To-morrow,
I must have a talk with him.”</p>

<p>“Might it not be well,” said the player, “first to find
out whether he is a friend or an enemy.”</p>

<p>“In any case, he is not likely to recognize me in this
guise,” said Gervase.</p>

<p>“It would be wise to take no chances, my friend,” said
the player.</p>

<p>The task he had set himself was now beginning to press
very heavily upon William Shakespeare. He well knew
it would be fatal to any plans he might evolve if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>fugitives learned what the business was that had sent the
falconer scouring the country-side. He must do all that
lay in his power to prevent the man conversing with
Gervase Heriot. And he must also contrive a means to
keep Anne Feversham out of his sight, lest he recognize
her in spite of her boy’s dress.</p>

<p>Thus it was in a state of dire perplexity that the player
sought his bed that night.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>R. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE rose early,
after a troubled night. Throughout its interminable
watches his mind had been dominated by
the necessity of keeping the falconer and the fugitives
apart. It was almost certain that the man would recognize
his young mistress. And if this came to pass, she
would learn at once her father’s tragic peril.</p>

<p>Soon or late, the news would have to be told her. At
least, that was the view Shakespeare had now come to
hold. But this was not the season for the Constable’s
daughter to learn what had happened. As the playwright
had lain sleepless that night in his bed, with the
eager brain racing courser-like over the whole matter,
the core of a plan had come to him. It was little more
than a shadow at present. It had yet to take shape, yet to
acquire a hue of reality, but it might be that under
providence it would develop into a scheme that could
offer some hope of their deliverance. Yet he must have
time in which to mature it; and if by a mischance the
fugitives learned at this moment Sir John Feversham’s
peril, nothing was more likely than that a self-sacrificing
impulse would cause them to give themselves up to justice
before anything could be done to help them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>All that day the falconer hung disconsolate about the
Crown Tavern. There was reason to believe that the
fugitives were still in the vicinity of Oxford, but for the
time being all further trace of them had failed. A number
of persons in and about the town appeared to have
seen the young gypsies. Among others, John Davenant,
the landlord of the Crown, had a clear recollection of
having seen them early the previous day on the bench outside
the tavern door. They could not be far away, yet
for the present the falconer’s inquiries yielded no result.</p>

<p>Shakespeare was careful to keep Gervase and Anne out
of the man’s way. He hardly let them out of his sight,
and during the performance that afternoon they were
given a secluded corner in one of the galleries where
they could enjoy the play without being seen by the
audience.</p>

<p>The piece was “Romeo and Juliet,” and its success was
as great as that which had been gained on the previous
day by “The Merchant of Venice.” News of that brilliant
performance had spread, so that the press in the inn
yard was greater than ever, there being hardly room to
squeeze another soul inside. This play was finely acted,
and it was received with bursts of rapturous applause.</p>

<p>It was part of the scheme that was being formed in
Shakespeare’s mind that Anne should play <i>Rosalind</i> before
the Queen. He knew that such an innovation would
be perilous, and he foresaw that it would arouse the opposition
of his colleagues. But that shy and slender grace
was the ideal of his fancy. He knew now that it was the
sight of her in hawking dress in the tailor’s shop that had
set his mind upon the forest of Arden. Parflete was an
efficient actor, but no member of the company could have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>the charm and delicacy of this gracious thing, if only she
could be taught to play the part at so short a notice.</p>

<p>The playwright was too astute even to tell Burbage of
the fantastic scheme that had come to lurk in his mind.
But he lost no time in giving Anne a copy of the play to
read. She declared herself enchanted by it. It was not
then, however, that he ventured to reveal to her his design.
And, in the meantime, perils were multiplying.</p>

<p>The man Grisewood remained three days in the privacy
of his chamber, suffering much pain during that time in
his disabled arm. And when at last he emerged with his
wound dressed in bandages, he hovered about the tavern
like a brooding and vengeful presence. If ever a man
might be said to be biding his hour in order to work mischief,
this was he. Yet for the present, it was little he
could accomplish. Moreover, he was constrained to keep
a civil tongue in his head, since Richard Burbage, who
was no respecter of persons, was fain to inform him that
the horse-trough was still likely to be his academy of
manners.</p>

<p>Grisewood, it appeared, had come to Oxford for a particular
purpose. That purpose was to seek out Simon
Heriot, his partner in infamy. He wished to inform him
of the prisoner’s escape, which was not generally known to
the world, and incidentally to learn what prospect there
was of being able to replenish a depleted exchequer.
This indeed was its permanent condition, so far as Sir
Robert Grisewood was concerned. But now that his foul
work was accomplished he looked to it to provide a source
of revenue for many years to come.</p>

<p>In the course of the day Grisewood chanced to inquire
of John Davenant, in the falconer’s hearing, whether he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>could direct him to Greenfield Manor, the house of Simon
Heriot The falconer’s attention was attracted, and presently
he entered into conversation with Grisewood. Both
men, at first, were not a little wary of each other. The
business of neither enabled them to open their hearts to
a chance acquaintance, but a few cautious questions
judiciously answered were enough to prove their common
interest in a matter which concerned them both very
deeply.</p>

<p>Grisewood had more cunning, and therefore less frankness,
than the falconer. Thus he asked questions rather
than answered them. And it was not long before he had
learned the nature of the falconer’s mission.</p>

<p>Markham, to be sure, was very loth to tell his story.
But once upon the track of it, Grisewood was not a man to
be gainsaid. On a pretence of being able to tell far
more than he knew, he drew the main particulars, word
by word, out of the reluctant falconer. Thus he learned
the manner of Gervase Heriot’s escape, and how the
fugitive was roaming the country-side in the company of
Sir John Feversham’s daughter.</p>

<p>This was high and strange news for Grisewood. Indeed,
Markham was one of the very few who knew this
fact. Not even the Queen herself was aware of it.</p>

<p>Had Markham been in a mood less desperate, he would
not have divulged the share of his young mistress in the
prisoner’s escape. But this man had affected to know
far more of the matter than, in point of fact, he did know;
besides, the falconer did not see how any words or any
act of his could make the affair more terrible than it was.
His one desire was to overtake the fugitives in order that
he might inform his young mistress of her father’s dire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>peril. This was neither more nor less than the morbid
craving of an overburdened conscience. It would not
be at his instance even if Gervase Heriot was given up to
justice. His wish was merely to make known to the
prisoner all that had occurred, and then leave any
further action in his hands. By this means the falconer
hoped to rid himself of the stain of his master’s blood.</p>

<p>As soon as Grisewood had heard the falconer’s story
he brought the whole force of his cunning mind to bear
upon the matter.</p>

<p>“You say, my friend, this traitor and Sir John’s young
daughter in a boy’s dress are roaming the country in the
guise of gypsies?”</p>

<p>“That I do,” said Markham.</p>

<p>Grisewood strove to amplify in his mind a picture the
falconer’s story had conjured up in it. At last he was
able to do this.</p>

<p>“By God’s life!” he said, “that was the pair of vagabonds
I saw in the company of that accursed play-actor
at the tavern door on the morning I came here.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call him accursed?” said Markham, remembering
with a pang that this player was a man in
whom he had already confided.</p>

<p>“Why do I call him accursed?” said Grisewood. “All
the world knows him for a notorious rogue, as are all men
of his sort. And I’ll wager a golden angel he is concealing
these fugitives in order to serve some purpose of his
own.”</p>

<p>“But why should he conceal them,” said the falconer,
“when there is a large sum on the head of Mr. Heriot?”</p>

<p>“A large sum, eh! The rogue may not know that.”</p>

<p>It was more to the purpose, perhaps, that the rogue who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>spoke had not known it. He grew silent. In this business
he must go cautiously indeed. It might be possible for
one who lived by his wits to take profit from this strange
business. At least, in his own mind, he was reasonably
sure of two things. The first was that the fugitives were
near at hand, the other that the play-actor was in a position
to throw light on their whereabouts.</p>

<p>The effect of this conversation was to keep Sir Robert
Grisewood very wideawake, and also to implant the seed
of distrust in the mind of Markham. It might be, after
all, that the player was not so open and honest as he
seemed. At any rate, the falconer determined to watch
him narrowly. With that end in view he marked all that
Shakespeare did. And he soon found more food for his
suspicions.</p>

<p>Close observation of the player’s comings and goings
enabled Markham to learn that there was a certain room
in the upper part of the inn, which claimed a large share
of his attention. Much of Shakespeare’s time was spent
in it. Another person who had recourse to it was a certain
tall man profusely endowed with a beard and moustachios,
said to be a foreigner, who had lately joined the
Lord Chamberlain’s Company. He was reputed to be a
swordsman of much skill, and in proof of it he had lately
given Grisewood a thrust through the arm.</p>

<p>The falconer was able to learn that this man, an Italian
who went by the name of Bandinello, had a son. And
although he, too, had joined the Lord Chamberlain’s Company,
and was staying at the Crown, Markham found it
impossible to get a sight of him. For one thing, neither
of these Italians took their meals with the rest of the
players in the dining-parlor, but as the falconer contrived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>to learn, these were served to them in this upper chamber.</p>

<p>This fact deepened Markham’s suspicions. He did not
think, well, however, to confide them to Grisewood. Inquiry
of the landlord had been sufficient to fix a very
evil reputation upon the man. And it had also served, in
a measure, to reassure Markham in respect of the player.
The landlord, who seemed a shrewd and honest fellow
enough, had no hesitation in affirming that William
Shakespeare was a very upright man.</p>

<p>Markham kept to himself his growing belief that the
player, for purposes of his own, was concealing the fugitives.
But the falconer, once engaged by this train of
thought, began to grow more and more certain that he
had good ground for his suspicion. A close scrutiny,
moreover, convinced him that Signor Bandinello was by
no means the individual he gave himself out to be.</p>

<p>Upon reaching this conclusion, Markham determined
on a bold course. By hook or by crook, he would get a
sight of this boy who was kept so close. Yet only one
means seemed to offer of doing this. He must choose a
favorable moment, and boldly invade this private room.
Doubtless the best time would be when the players were
assembled at supper in the dining-parlor.</p>

<p>In accordance with this plan he watched a servant ascend
with a tray of food, and then a few minutes later he
walked fearlessly into the room.</p>

<p>As John Markham had surmised would be the case, he
found two persons seated at supper. One was the so-called
Italian music master, and the other was doubtless
the person who had passed as his son. But, with a single
glance of an almost terrified swiftness, the falconer was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>able to pierce the disguise. For all her close-clipt curls
and her boy’s dress, the second occupant of the room was
undoubtedly his young mistress.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the falconer was fully prepared
for the discovery he had made, he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>Signor Bandinello sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“What is your pleasure?” he asked sharply, and in an
English as pure as any man need wish to use.</p>

<p>For an instant, the two men stood looking at one another
blankly, while Anne’s dismay was so great that she
could neither speak nor move. But each of these men
had recognized the other already.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt this was the man the falconer sought.
Also this was the servant of Sir John Feversham, whom
Gervase had encountered in the meadow.</p>

<p>Gervase laid his hand to his sword.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” said Markham, simply. “I am here as your
friend, and as&mdash;and as the humble servant of my mistress.”</p>

<p>The sound of the falconer’s voice broke the spell that
had been laid upon Anne. She rose from the table, and
in spite of all that she had undergone of suffering, something
of the old imperiousness was in her tone.</p>

<p>“What do you here, John Markham?”</p>

<p>“I bring news, mistress.”</p>

<p>“Of whom?”</p>

<p>“I bring news of your father, mistress.”</p>

<p>“Of my father!”</p>

<p>It seemed almost too great an effort for Anne to cast
back her mind to the stern man whose very existence she
had nearly forgotten. In the stress of those terrible
weeks, which had called for all that she had of endurance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>her former life had grown so vague, so remote that it was
almost as if it had never been.</p>

<p>“What of my father?”</p>

<p>Tragedy unspeakable was in the falconer’s face. For
the moment, a power outside himself forbade his answering
the question. Days and nights had he given to this
quest, that a load of misery might be taken from his heart.
But now that at last his tireless wanderings had achieved
their purpose, a force beyond his own will held him
captive.</p>

<p>The falconer knew as he gazed at his young mistress
that it was her life he was about to sacrifice in order to
save his master’s. It was her youth and her high devotion
in the scale, against one who had lived the flower
of his years. Surely it behoved him to have a care.</p>

<p>“What of my father?”</p>

<p>The man shook his head impotently.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“No, mistress, he is not dead.”</p>

<p>But in the falconer’s tone was that which sent a chill
to the heart of Sir John Feversham’s daughter. In spite
of himself, Markham had told her that which he would
now have concealed.</p>

<p>“My father is in peril?”</p>

<p>Again there was silence. But the woman’s swift instinct
all too soon divined its meaning.</p>

<p>“In peril. And it is because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>A shudder went through her veins. She buried her
face in her hands.</p>

<p>A dreadful anguish came upon the falconer. Any
words he would have spoken died on his lips.</p>

<p>In the midst of this unhappy scene Shakespeare entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the room. His eye fell on the somber figure of
the falconer. And then he saw the piteous face of
Anne.</p>

<p>“Oh, what have you done!” The player’s bitterly reproachful
words were heard only by the falconer.</p>

<p>Markham shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>Gervase turned a distracted face upon the player.</p>

<p>“This man is concealing something,” he said. “What
it is, I do not know. Perhaps you can tell us.”</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that Markham’s presence in the
room had taken Shakespeare altogether by surprise, he
seemed to realize the situation almost at once. Gervase
Heriot’s air of bewilderment and the falconer’s look of
pitiful irresolution served to make it clear that the man’s
will had failed when it came to the telling of his story.</p>

<p>But it was equally clear to that powerful intelligence
that Anne had come very near to divining the grim truth.
She was the picture of woe. And her distress could only
proceed from one cause.</p>

<p>“You say my father is in peril!” Heedless of the player’s
presence her words were addressed to John Markham.
“And it is because of me.”</p>

<p>The falconer did not answer. But his white face answered
for him.</p>

<p>“Tell me all, John Markham. I must, I will know all.”</p>

<p>In the presence of that instancy of will which now as
ever held the falconer in thrall, he could not do less than
obey. It was in vain that the player sought to check him.</p>

<p>In a few broken, brief words, the dismal story was
told.</p>

<p>“Sir John lies in the Tower, mistress, in peril of his
life. He is accused of complicity in his prisoner’s escape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>On Monday next, as I understand, he is to be brought to
his trial. And it is likely to go hard with him if he makes
no effort to clear himself. And that, I am sure, he will
not do.”</p>

<p>Gervase interposed sharply.</p>

<p>“Why do you say Sir John Feversham will not attempt
to clear himself?”</p>

<p>“For the reason, sir,” said the falconer, gravely and
simply, “that in such a case as this, it would not be my
master’s character.”</p>

<p>“How can you possibly know that?” asked Gervase.</p>

<p>The falconer shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“You are not acquainted with my master,” he said.
“Even to save his life, he is not the man to tell all that
he knows of this matter.”</p>

<p>“That is to say,” said Gervase, “he has withheld a certain
fact from the Queen?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Despair closed upon Gervase and Anne. They did not
need to be told that Sir John Feversham had taken upon
himself the whole responsibility for his prisoner’s escape,
and that not a word had crossed his lips in regard to the
share his daughter had in it.</p>

<p>One thought sprang at once to the minds of the fugitives.
It was impossible in such circumstances to leave
Sir John to his fate. All the laws of honor, of filial duty
forbade such a course.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you tell them!” said the player to John
Markham. The too sensitive soul felt the stab of tragedy
in its inmost fiber.</p>

<p>“It was right that he should,” said Gervase. “It was
his bounden duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Gervase had grown as pale as death, but already resolve
had braced his will. He saw at once that only one
course was open to him, and that was the one the player
himself had foreseen.</p>

<p>Yet no issue could have been more tragic. It was death
for Gervase, and in the circumstances of the case, it
was also death for Anne. All this the player understood,
and even the thrice unhappy falconer seemed to
realize it.</p>

<p>Gervase’s mind was soon made up. He would go at
once to London and surrender himself to the Queen. He
would start that night or at dawn at the latest, since it
seemed to him there was not an hour to be lost.</p>

<p>The player, however, had only to learn this impetuous
resolve, in order to declare himself strongly averse from
it. A plan which promised some hope of deliverance, a
very slender one, it was true, had been taking shape in
his mind for three days past. Any such precipitancy of
action would destroy it. Therefore, he entreated Gervase
to defer a step that must prove irretrievably fatal
until such time as his scheme might have a chance to
mature.</p>

<p>Shakespeare well knew how hazardous, indeed how
fantastic his plan was. And he was far too honest a man
to promise more than its desperate character warranted.
But he did all that he could to dissuade Gervase from his
intention. He implored the young man not to act until
that day week, at which time the Lord Chamberlain’s men
had to appear before the Queen. It might then be possible
to gain her ear. Gervase, however, would not consent
to this. His thoughts were dominated completely by
the peril of a brave and chivalrous man. Indeed, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>as much as the player could do to persuade him to defer
his departure for London until the next day.</p>

<p>Finally, Shakespeare was able to wring a reluctant
promise from Gervase that he would not act upon his resolve
the following morning, until such time as they had
met to discuss it again. And for the time being, at any
rate, that was the utmost the play-actor could contrive.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was little sleep that night either for
William Shakespeare or for Gervase Heriot. The
early morning found them together in the inn
garden. And as they walked up and down its box-bordered
alleys, they talked long and very earnestly and in a
manner utterly heedless of their surroundings.</p>

<p>In this last matter, they were unlucky. Several of the
tavern windows overlooked the garden, and one at least
was open wide. This belonged to the room which was
occupied by the man Grisewood, who lay sleepless on a
comfortless pillow, still tormented by his wound. Unable
to rest, he chanced to rise from his couch in the early
hours, and thrust his aching head out of the window in
order to get a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>His attention was caught at once by the sound of
voices and of footsteps on the gravel path below. Then it
was he saw the play-actor in deep conversation with the
man who had run him through the arm. The sight was
enough to summon all that Grisewood had of cunning,
and in his case, as it happened, this was a commodity of
which nature had been lavish.</p>

<p>At once, he knelt down by the casement, in order that
he might see without being seen. Then he listened very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>intently. The process was irritatingly difficult He was
only able to hear brief, disjointed fragments of the conversation
that was passing below. But it was continued
long enough to enable the listener to weave into some
kind of a context the few scraps of talk which he was able
to glean.</p>

<p>Without any sort of doubt, the man who had run him
through the arm was Gervase Heriot in a cunning disguise.
Such a thrill of joy passed through the heart of
the listener as almost to compensate for the pain and indignity
he had recently undergone. It would appear that
the fugitive was bent upon a course of action from which
the play-actor was doing all in his power to dissuade him.
Exactly what it was that was passing between them,
Grisewood could not for the life of him make out. Long
they talked together as they slowly paced the garden, yet
even when they left it at last, the listener was unable to
gather the full gist of their conversation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he returned to his bed a very well satisfied
man. Opportunity for revenge lay under his hand.
Moreover, he hoped to be able to pay off his score with
the player. And even beyond this doubly welcome prospect,
there was the further consolation of the high price
that had been set on the head of a condemned traitor.</p>

<p>These prospects were very dazzling in the sight of Sir
Robert Grisewood. And such scope did they offer that
gentleman for the exercise of his peculiar faculties, that
he was almost afraid he would not be able to grasp them
to the full. He must not act hastily. Let him give the
whole force of his mind to the great possibilities of revenge
that were spread before it. Let him strike at his
leisure, and only after ample consideration of the case in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>all its bearings. Justice, full and complete, must be done
to the really wonderful opportunity that had been given
him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Shakespeare’s long conversation with
the fugitive in the inn garden had borne fruit. With infinite
difficulty had he been able to persuade the young
man to forego his surrender to the law for that day, at
least. And with even this small concession, the player
was not dissatisfied, for it seemed that during the watches
of the night the scheme in his mind had developed considerably.</p>

<p>Its nature was certainly very complex and hazardous.
And the player asked of Gervase that he would trust him
to carry it out without calling upon him to furnish details.
Shakespeare desired the young man to await the
issue of his plan with an open mind. And as there was
all for Gervase to gain, and there was nothing he could
lose, and as he had already learned to have faith in this
man who had certainly played the part of a friend, he
consented to do the will of the actor, and at the same
time to ask as few questions as need be.</p>

<p>It was a strange situation. And if Gervase had not
an implicit faith in the player, it could never have arisen.
But the man’s intense sympathy wrought upon him. And,
after all, it was not a matter of his own life alone, or
even of the life of Sir John Feversham. He had to consider
that of the girl who had dared and done so much.</p>

<p>Thus, for one day more, he was willing to defer his
surrender to the Queen. And to this he was impelled by
the knowledge that whatever course he took, it would not
now be possible to avoid bringing Sir John Feversham to
his trial. The law must inevitably take its course, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>there would still be time and opportunity to save the Constable
even after he was condemned.</p>

<p>It had been Grisewood’s intention to pay his visit to
Greenfield Manor that day. But the discovery he had
made caused him to alter his plan of action. He felt he
must take time to consider the new position which had
arisen. Therefore, he decided not to see Simon Heriot
at once. It would be well, he thought, to stay where he
was in order that he might watch affairs closely and gain
a further knowledge of that which was taking place.</p>

<p>Delays, however, are dangerous. Grisewood was not
aware of the fact that his change of plan was very welcome
to the play-actor. Indeed, nothing could have better
suited Shakespeare’s design. From the many inquiries
he had recently made in regard to Simon Heriot,
there was good reason to suppose that the man believed
his nephew to be dead. And as this belief was essential
to the fantastic design that was maturing in the subtle
brain of this maker of plays, it was beyond all things
necessary that, for the present, it should not be disturbed.</p>

<p>Thus when, in the course of that morning, Shakespeare
learned from the landlord that Grisewood had decided
not to visit Greenfield Manor until the next day a weight
of anxiety was taken from his mind. Nothing could have
accorded better with his purpose. Moreover, it put him
in great heart for his enterprise, and provided a further
reason for its being carried through without delay.</p>

<p>To be sure, the scheme was whimsical, extravagant,
fantastic. It was of a kind that could only have sprung
from a daringly original invention. And perhaps only
the optimism of one whose life was largely that of the
fancy could have expected it to yield any material result.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
But it was with the zest of a schoolboy that the
playwright drew his friend, Burbage, aside before that
morning was out, and over a tankard of October ale
with a toast in it, inquired “whether he was ripe for a
midnight frolic?”</p>

<p>“Ripe as a medlar, my old lad of Stratford-on-Avon
in Warwickshire,” said the tragedian, heartily.</p>

<p>“Then we will give what we are pleased to call our
minds to a stratagem, dear shrew, which I hope we may be
able this night to put on a dark knave.”</p>

<p>“I care not so long as there is mirth in it,” said the
tragedian.</p>

<p>“Mirth enough in it, I promise you, if we can but draw
this badger out of his hole. But we must go well armed,
in case of trouble, and we must have horses for a journey
ten miles out and home.”</p>

<p>“What! more Charlecote adventures?”</p>

<p>“Nay, you egregious mime, a thing of more account
than a coney or two. It is to save the life of an innocent
man and, as we will hope, to lose a foul knave his
head.”</p>

<p>The tragedian, in accordance with a cautious, practical
and sagacious disposition, began to look dubious.</p>

<p>“I am by no means clear,” he said, “that Richard
Burbage was designed by nature for knight errantry.”</p>

<p>“No harm shall come of this adventure, I promise you.
But all I ask is, that your dove’s voice shall roar a little
like the Nubian lion; and that your large assemblance
shall make us look valiant in the light of the moon.”</p>

<p>“That will I promise, if I have but a flask of canary
within me.”</p>

<p>“It is a choicely pretty stratagem. And if there is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>miscarriage, I think we may obtain a night’s honest
amusement at the expense of one who looks not to provide
it.”</p>

<p>“What is your plan, you mad maker of plays? And
what is its aim and object?”</p>

<p>“All in a good season you shall be told. But first, we
must prick our band for the wars. I name myself captain
generalissimo, and I name Richard Burbage, a large
man, frowardly given, for my ancient. And for my
squire, I name young Parflete, whose light limbs and
smooth face and gentle air make innocence herself seem
a baggage. And then I will name Lowin, an honest,
good fellow with wit enough not to ask questions, and
stout Kemp who is a wag but not a fool, and of course
Heriot, this poor ill-used young man whose life I will
save, I am determined upon it.”</p>

<p>“All the same, my William, I would learn the nature
of your stratagem,” said Burbage, tenaciously.</p>

<p>“Nay, Richard, possess your soul in patience for the
nonce. The stratagem is a good stratagem, else may I
never drink sack out of a bombard again. But I must
now seek young Mr. Heriot and assemble horses for
our troop.”</p>

<p>It was part of the man’s character, and a strong part,
that when once the mind was fully aroused, it could
combine the power of action with an infinite faculty of invention.
It was not always easy for him to see his way
at the beginning of an enterprise. Like so many upon
whom the heavy burden of imagination has been laid,
the will was apt to be weak at times. But if only the
occasion called imperiously, he had a power of concentration
that enabled him to overcome the indecision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>which is the cruel curse that nature has laid upon the
thinker.</p>

<p>Now that William Shakespeare had conceived the high
project of saving the life of an innocent man, mind and
will were working in full harmony to compass this end.
He saw clearly what had to be done; and a blend of
many high qualities lent him the power to conceive and
to carry out a scheme which few men would have had
the audacity to undertake.</p>

<p>He bade Gervase and Anne be of good heart. Yet
he withheld the main particulars of his design. He told
them merely that his purpose was to ride at sundown
to the house of Simon Heriot, that was some ten miles
off, in the company of Burbage, Kemp and other of
the players. It would be necessary for Gervase to accompany
them. With a light of humor in his eye, the
playwright assured him that if fortune was kind he had
a plan that might prove very pleasant, whimsical and
diverting to all except him against whom it was to be
directed.</p>

<p>“But, tell me, what it is, I pray you?” said Gervase.</p>

<p>Shakespeare shook his head.</p>

<p>“The hour is not yet,” he said. “I’ faith, it is one
of those whimsical matters which endure the performance
better than the description. I only ask that you trust
me to the full and do my will, whatever it be; and, for
my part, I will promise that your case shall not be made
in anywise worse than it now is, and under Providence
shall be made a good deal better.”</p>

<p>Knowing so little of the plan, Gervase found it hard
not to be sceptical. But this man had already gained
his confidence. He was hardly likely to promise that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>which he had no prospect of being able to perform.
Moreover, there was no reason in the world why he
should put a trick upon one in so sorry a plight as Gervase,
unless he was an emissary of his enemies. And
this the fugitive had no reason to suppose. For had
he not treated Anne and himself with unfailing kindness,
nay, with something beyond kindness&mdash;with a tenderness,
a delicacy of compassion which no gratitude
could ever repay?</p>

<p>Shakespeare presently delivered a solemn charge to
the melancholy-visaged John Davenant, of whom there
was a tradition that he had never been known to
smile.</p>

<p>“Right excellent host,” said the player, with a whimsical
air, “I would have you place at our disposal about
the hour friend Phoebus enters his cradle, the eight
trustiest and lustiest steeds to be found in this city.
John Davenant, on your honor as a licensed victualler,
do I charge you to give the whole of your mind to this
matter. An affair of great pith and moment is toward
as soon as the sun has gone down.”</p>

<p>“Is it that you are leaving us to-night, Will?” said
the host of the Crown Tavern, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“Nay, mine host. But a choice little pleasantry is
afoot, and it demands that all who bear a share in it
should be well horsed.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are ever a mad faggot,” said John Davenant.
“And a man never knows what whimsey you will
take next.”</p>

<p>“Peace, honest vintner. And upon your life as a famous
Christian man, do I charge you to do my behest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Thoroughly mystified, John Davenant went to carry
out these instructions, perhaps a trifle unwillingly.
But he was an old friend of William Shakespeare, and
although a somber fellow enough on the outside, there
was a light of humor within. Besides, he had a very
real respect for the moving spirit of the Lord Chamberlain’s
Company.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>REENFIELD MANOR was a very old house
about ten miles out of Oxford. It lay in a secluded
spot, but the road to London ran past
the high walls of its park. A heavy growth of trees
surrounded the house itself, which was in a state of
neglect and disrepair.</p>

<p>A gloomy and forbidding place enough. The very atmosphere
which invested this mass of decaying stonework
seemed to invite ghosts to walk. Its chimneys
rocked continually; its windows rattled. When the vane
over the decrepit stables swung in the wind of the summer
night, it was as if some lost soul was seeking to
escape out of Hades.</p>

<p>As a fact, the house was certainly inhabited by a
lost soul. Simon Heriot, its master, lay in the belief
that he had done his nephew to death by a subtle,
mean and cruel device. And no worthier purpose than
greed had been in his heart. It had been his life-long
passion to hold the fair manor and the broad lands in
the west country, which generations of his name had
held before him. These, however, had descended to
the son of his elder brother. And the knowledge
that there was only one life intervening between him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>and his great ambition, in the end, became too much for
him.</p>

<p>The means to do ill deeds oft makes ill deeds done.
It was by chance that the design was unfolded to Simon
Heriot of swearing away his nephew’s life. But when
occasion came to him he did not resist the call. The
pent-up forces of his covetous envy rose up and slew
him.</p>

<p>If ever a man might be said to have sold himself to the
devil, that man was Simon Heriot. He had a cunning
and subtle mind; moreover, he was very well acquainted
with the world in which he lived. He was clever enough
to make the entail of his nephew’s estates the price of
his testimony. And, indeed, it was no uncommon thing
in that day to reward those who brought and proved
charges of high treason with the property of the people
they had hounded to the scaffold. The times were very
perilous for all men. The life of no man was safe. Black
hatred and superstitious fear of the Pope, and his emissaries
were rife throughout the land. In such circumstances,
it was easy for a cunning and unscrupulous man
to remove a rival from his path by some form of legal
process. The character of the evidence was seldom
tested. It was enough if it served the purpose it had
in view. Gervase Heriot was not the first by many
who had been done to death under the ready sanctions
of the law.</p>

<p>Howbeit, Simon Heriot, with all his knowledge of
men and of the world, was without knowledge of the
power of God. As soon as the news was brought to
him that his nephew was condemned to the block, a
singular change came over his life. The success of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>his design gave him not a crumb of satisfaction; indeed
he took a morbid, an overmastering distaste for the
society of his fellows. He shut himself up in his gloomy
manor house with his old and stupid servants. He
shunned the light of day. His one desire was to avert his
face from all men and from the sight of Heaven.</p>

<p>A brooding lethargy fixed itself upon his soul. A
kind of slow horror stole into his brain. He could not
settle his mind to anything. Asleep or awake, he knew
no peace. He would have undone his deed could he
have found the courage that such an act demanded.</p>

<p>This night was as many others. After a solitary meal
in a large, dim, comfortless room, Simon Heriot
sat long at the table, staring straight before him at the
huge open fireplace, whose emptiness was like a yawning
chasm. At his elbow had been set a large flagon of
wine, of which he drank continually.</p>

<p>There was not a sound in the old house, save that
made by an occasional mouse behind the paneling. The
servants had gone to bed; it was near eleven o’clock of
a perfectly still and moonless summer’s evening; and
Simon Heriot was alone with his thoughts.</p>

<p>Wine, it is true, did a little to soften their sting.
But when the hand of God has been laid upon a man,
it is not amenable to human resources. Behind that
dull lethargy of spirit was a never-ceasing pressure.
Strange phantoms had begun to lurk on the edge of the
outer darkness, away beyond the flickering half-light of
the candles on the table.</p>

<p>At last, in sheer fatigue, the unhappy man began to
doze. Worn out in mind and body, he fell presently
into a troubled sleep. But his unquietness of spirit would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>not let him rest. He awoke with a start. There was a
sense of a continual presence, unseen but all-pervading,
in the room.</p>

<p>He strained his eyes beyond the circle of light made
by the candles set on the table at which he sat. But
away in the ghostly outer darkness of the large room,
he could discern no visible shape. He strove to fix some
faint and remote sound that thrilled in his ears. But,
after all, it was only the little sound of the summer
wind stirring in the trees.</p>

<p>Again the jaded brain tried to pierce together the
slender core of will that might disperse these phantoms
and perhaps enable it to sleep. But it was not to be.
Each night as he sat there, besieged by this horror
that had entered his soul, the will grew more inert.
There was a faint voice within that had begun to whisper
to him that he would never sleep again.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true. He would never sleep again. He
was tormented by unseen phantoms. Never again
would he know peace in this life and perhaps never in
the life to come.</p>

<p>Once again he strained his ears to listen. It was only
the little voice of the summer wind in the wide chimney-place.
All was silence save for that. Yet there was an
abiding sense of an unseen, all-pervading presence in
the room. And then, quite suddenly, without warning
of any kind, a thing happened that made the very soul
of Simon Heriot recoil.</p>

<p>He was sitting at the table, his head resting on his
hand. His back was to the wide chimney-place, but
as he sat his body was half turned towards it. On his
right hand was a long, low casement. It was curtainless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
but was covered on the outside by a wooden shutter.
On his left hand, at the opposite end of the room,
was another casement precisely similar except that it was
smaller.</p>

<p>All at once, without warning and without any apparent
cause, the shutters of the right-hand casement were
flung to the ground. Simon Heriot turned his head
with a startled cry. His wild eyes stared out into the
night. At first, he could see nothing but the cavernous
darkness. Yet as he was still gazing, a light was flashed
suddenly across the window, and then he saw that a
white, ghostly face was pressed against the pane and
was looking into the room.</p>

<p>The apparition was so real, so vivid, that Simon Heriot
rose half swooning with terror and walked across to the
window.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he gasped.</p>

<p>He had no need to ask. It was the face of the young
man, his nephew, whom, as he believed, he had done to
death.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” shrieked the wretched man.</p>

<p>He stumbled forward to the window. But when he
came there all was dark again. The light was gone, and
the face of his nephew had vanished.</p>

<p>Like a lost soul, trembling upon the verge of unreason,
he stood at the window gazing far out into the
void. But there was only the darkness of the night
and the little voice of the summer wind. Yet if he
was not in a dream, or if he was not yet bereft of
his wits, the shutters were indubitably prone on the
ground.</p>

<p>After a moment, the unhappy man turned away from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>the window, unable longer to endure that cavern of
darkness which confronted him. Yet, hardly had he done
so, when the shutters which covered the window at the
other end of the long room were flung to the ground
with a violent crash.</p>

<p>Simon Heriot screamed with terror. There again was
the flash of the light. There again was the face of his
nephew pressed against the window. Like one possessed,
the unhappy man stumbled across the room to this other
window. But by the time he had reached it, the light
and the face were gone.</p>

<p>There was nothing but the night. All was silence.
And there was nought to be seen out in the darkness.
He uttered another wild scream of terror.</p>

<p>Shuddering in every vein, he withdrew his eyes from
the window. As he sought the table for support, he
almost fell. And then as he reached it, his heart seemed
to stop beating. For a voice deep and terrible filled the
room, echoing and re-echoing in it, making its spacious
gloom resound.</p>

<p>“Simon Heriot!”</p>

<p>He heard his name.</p>

<p>“Simon Heriot!”</p>

<p>The voice of the unseen re-echoed high in the wide
chimney-place. The heart of the unhappy wretch was
already dead within him.</p>

<p>“Simon Heriot has murdered sleep!”</p>

<p>In a frenzy that seemed to tear his soul in pieces,
he pressed his hands to his ears that they might be
closed against the sound. But it was in vain. No human
agency had the power to shut out those terrible words,
or the awful voice that gave them utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Simon Heriot, if ever you would sleep again, attend
that which is said to you.”</p>

<p>With the shred of will that remained to him, the guilty
man strung all his faculties in order to heed the words
that were spoken.</p>

<p>“Do you attend, Simon Heriot.” The voice was low,
deep and terrible. “Do you take a candle and sit at
yonder table, upon which materials for writing are set,
and do you write as you are now directed.”</p>

<p>It was true that quill, inkhorn and foolscap were laid
out on a small table at the other end of the room. At
the beck of that which he was powerless to disobey, the
unhappy man tottered very slowly towards the table.
After a moment of indecision, he sat down and took up
the quill. He was as one in a dream, except that his
head seemed to be bursting.</p>

<p>“Simon Heriot, write as you are directed.”</p>

<p>The terrible voice had now grown so loud and so
compelling, that it seemed to tear his brain asunder.
When he took up the pen, his trembling fingers could
hardly hold it.</p>

<p>Very slowly and very clearly, the voice then uttered
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I, Simon Heriot, in the presence of Almighty God
and with the shadow of death upon me, hereby solemnly
declare, that I have caused to be borne to our Sovereign
Lady the Queen, false testimony in the matter of my
nephew, Gervase Heriot. I further declare that I suborned
three men, Robert Grisewood, John Nixon and
Gregory Bannister by name, to bear false testimony
touching the complicity of the said Gervase Heriot in
the Round House Plot, by reason of which alleged complicity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the said Gervase Heriot has been condemned to
death. In the presence of Almighty God, and as I
shortly hope for eternal rest, I do hereby most solemnly
avow what I have written to be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth. Given under my hand
this second day of July, 1599&mdash;Simon Heriot.”</p></div>

<p>Under the goad of terror, the guilty man gathered
every fragment of his crumbling will in order that he
might set pen to paper. No less slowly than the grim
voice pronounced the words, Simon Heriot wrote them
down with a kind of automatic precision. It was as if
his highly wrought state had become susceptible to a
process of hypnotism.</p>

<p>When at last the task was finished and he had signed
the document which made full confession of his crime,
he was commanded to open a window and to fling out
the paper into the night.</p>

<p>He would have had neither the strength nor the courage
to do this of his own volition. But the dread voice
compelled him. He rose from the writing-table, but
now such was his condition that he could hardly stand.
A palsy was on his limbs; he was as one who has lost
all control of his mind.</p>

<p>“Take heed, Simon Heriot.”</p>

<p>He knew not whence the voice came, yet a power
beyond himself compelled implicit obedience. Scarcely
able to walk, he tottered toward the casement at the
other end of the wide room.</p>

<p>He was destined never to reach it. With a dismal cry,
he stopped midway. The paper fluttered out of his hand.
Suddenly, he fell face down on the stone floor, a slight
foam on his lips.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ARDLY had this thing come to pass, when a
number of startled faces appeared on the outer
side of the shutterless window. Shaking
and rattling did not serve to force an entrance, but by
the time the combined pressure of four or five vigorous
and determined men had been applied, the framework
began to yield. Very soon they had made their way into
the room.</p>

<p>Simon Heriot was dead.</p>

<p>One glance at the horrible distorted face was enough
to tell Gervase Heriot what had occurred. There was
no need for the young man to get down on his knees,
candle in hand, and loosen the man’s clothing. Simon
Heriot had already breathed his last.</p>

<p>The men who had come with Gervase into the room
belonged one and all to the Lord Chamberlain’s Company.
The first of these was William Shakespeare whose fantastically
ingenious device had been fraught with such
tragic consequences. It had succeeded beyond hope or
expectation. Richard Burbage’s had been the voice which
had re-echoed down the wide chimney with such ghastly
effect.</p>

<p>“Dead?” said the playwright, looking round at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>circle of astonished and half-terrified faces. And then
he said, with a passionate solemnity, with a look of terror
in his own dark-glowing eyes, “God rest his soul.
His crime was black, but he has paid for it with usury.
God rest his unhappy soul.”</p>

<p>A chill of silence fell upon all who had entered the
room. In a sense, they had done this man to death,
and perhaps that thought was even more potent in their
minds than the grim and awful tragedy they had witnessed.</p>

<p>After a while, the spell was broken. Burbage picked
up the paper that had fallen to the floor. He examined
it by the ghostly light of the candles, and then handed it
to the man who had caused it to be written.</p>

<p>It might have been supposed that the text would have
been expressed in a handwriting barely decipherable, but
such was not the case. The writing was sufficiently
clear to bear no reasonable doubt of its authenticity.
By a process of hypnotic suggestion the man’s mind had
been strung up to a point beyond its natural powers, and
it had not given way until the last word had been
written.</p>

<p>Shakespeare folded up the paper and put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I will bear this to the Queen myself,” he said.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some of the others had raised the
body of Simon Heriot from the ground and had laid it
on a table. But Shakespeare bore no part in all this. It
was not that he was callous; it was simply that the sight
of death revolted him.</p>

<p>After the body had been placed on the table, one and
all waited upon the word of the leader of the enterprise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>who had devised all that had come to pass. But now
his power seemed to have gone from him. Having done
so much more than he had meant to do, he was as one
overborne by the sense of his deed. He now confronted
his fellow-players haplessly, apparently not knowing what
to do next or what advice to give.</p>

<p>As it happened, however, all further decision was taken
out of his hands. While one and all stood awaiting that
masterful initiative that was no longer at their service,
the door of the room was opened very stealthily, and two
of the dead man’s servants entered. Each carried a
candle and a fowling-piece.</p>

<p>Both men were evidently in deadly fear of their lives,
but a sense of duty had prevailed with them over a desire
for personal safety.</p>

<p>“How, now, you masterless rogues,” said one, who
was the butler, in a voice by no means valiant. “What
do you here?”</p>

<p>Before it was possible to answer the question, the
antiquated weapon he carried went off with a loud report,
which seemed to make the room rock to its foundations,
and half choked all those in it with the fumes of smoke
and gunpowder. It was the result of accident, certainly
not of design, but a cry arose from among the players.</p>

<p>“Oh, God!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the young man Parflete.</p>

<p>“Put up your weapons, you fools,” cried Gervase.</p>

<p>The unlucky Parflete had fallen against the table.
Anxiously they crowded round the man who had been
hit, while the butler and the old serving man who was
with him, seeing their master’s nephew of the company,
laid down their weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The young actor had been hit in the arm. It hung
helpless and bloody by his side. Suddenly he fainted,
and Gervase had only just time enough to catch him in
his arms.</p>

<p>William Kemp, the famous comedian and creator of
the rôle of <i>Falstaff</i>, who was one of those who had borne
a part in this tragic conspiracy, had the presence of
mind to seize a horn of brandy that was on the table.
Having first, by a free application to his own throat,
been able to satisfy himself that the liquor was capable
of stimulating the heart’s action, he poured a goodly portion
of it down the throat of his wounded comrade.</p>

<p>There was virtue in this remedy. But the unlucky
young player lay shivering with pain in the arms of
Gervase, while Burbage attended an ugly wound with
considerable skill.</p>

<p>First he cut away the dripping sleeve of the doublet
with his clasped knife. Then a basin of water was
brought and he bathed the wound, and finally bound
up the arm tightly in a clean handkerchief. But by the
time this had been done, Parflete was again insensible.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the two servants had discovered that
their master was dead. And the horror of that discovery
was increased by the presence of his nephew, whom
they had presumed to be dead also. Furthermore, they
were not acquainted with the black part their master
had played. Thus their grief and horror were perfectly
sincere.</p>

<p>The arrival of what certainly appeared to be a lawless
company of lawless and masterless men, had
plunged already the entire household into a state of
alarm. The cries and the noise of firearms had at once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>aroused the rest of the indoor servants. In a few minutes,
these had come crowding into the room. And as
soon as they had learned what had occurred, matters
began to take an ugly shape.</p>

<p>The steward of Simon Heriot, who had now appeared
on the scene, was a man of resolute character. He declared
that he would hold in custody those who had
been responsible for his master’s death, notwithstanding
that one among them was his master’s nephew. Accordingly,
he sent one man to call the outdoor servants; he
sent another to procure a horse from the stables and
ride with all haste to the nearest justice; also he proclaimed
the fact that he would suffer no man to escape.</p>

<p>In that, perhaps, although his intention was excellent,
he was not wise. The players, including Gervase and
the falconer, mustered nine men in all, against seven
men and four women. To be sure, one of the intruders
was sorely disabled and would require the careful tendance
of his friends if he was to be brought securely
away. But, in the matter of arms, the advantage was
with the players, inasmuch that most of them were
provided with swords, and they had only to fear one
undischarged fowling-piece and divers staves and short
daggers.</p>

<p>Gervase now took command of affairs. He approached
his uncle’s steward coolly enough, for all that the man
preserved a very threatening attitude with his weapon
pointed ominously at the players.</p>

<p>“Put it up, you curst fool!” said Gervase, roundly.
“Haven’t you done mischief enough already?”</p>

<p>“Not half the mischief you have done, sir,” said the
man. “Come not an inch nearer or I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Before the steward could complete his threat or carry
it into effect, Gervase suddenly struck up his arm. The
piece went off with a tremendous report. This time,
happily, its contents were discharged into the air.</p>

<p>In the midst of the smoke and the general confusion,
Gervase flung himself upon the steward and, with the
strength and the address of youth, soon wrenched the
clumsy weapon from his hands. Then, with a blow on
the head from the butt of the weapon, he laid the man
insensible.</p>

<p>“Through the window, my friends,” he cried to his
comrades. “Let us get out of this while we have the
chance.”</p>

<p>Gervase had now become the leader of the players&mdash;for
a time at least. Already he had shown that faculty
of quick initiative which belongs to the man of
action. The others obeyed him instinctively. His swift
decision, and the manner in which his deed leaped with
his thought, showed them clearly enough that they would
do well to follow him.</p>

<p>Burbage was first through the window. He was a
powerful and active man. He lifted out Parflete bodily
and then, hoisting him on his broad shoulders, began
to run with him in the direction of the horses which
were tethered in the lane. It was well that the wounded
actor was very light of weight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the others were rendering a pretty good
account of themselves. A general mêlée had ensued, in
which blows were given freely and given as freely again.
And in all this, Gervase was foremost. Many shrewd
knocks he delivered with the butt of his weapon, and
one of these undoubtedly saved Shakespeare a broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>head. John Markham, the falconer, also did considerable
execution with the flat of his short sword.</p>

<p>The onfall of the players had been so swift as to take
Simon Heriot’s servants by surprise. And, after all,
the resistance they had to offer was not very stout.
Thus those who had forced so irregular an entry were
soon in excellent shape for making good their escape
by way of the window through which they had come.</p>

<p>The breach in the casement their entrance had caused
was a large one. And with far less difficulty than they
had reason to expect were they able to withdraw from
the room. Also, they suffered no further casualty beyond
a few ill-directed blows that did them little hurt.</p>

<p>The dead man’s servants were less fortunate. Several
were laid low, although none of their injuries was serious.
But these early mishaps had killed any desire that might
have lurked in the others to press the conflict beyond
the point of discretion. No very serious effort was made
to impede the flight of Gervase Heriot and his friends,
whom one and all of the dead man’s household honestly
believed had done his uncle to death.</p>

<p>It was not a difficult matter for the players to reach
their horses which had been left in the lane. Shakespeare,
who was a good horseman, and who had contrived
to be well mounted, had the wounded man lifted
on to the front of his saddle.</p>

<p>Parflete was still very weak from loss of blood and
the shock of his wound. He was quite unable to take
care of himself. But the playwright was full of solicitude
for the young man. Also it was fortunate that they
both rode light. Shakespeare, although well knit of
figure, was hardly more than a ten stone man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>The horses were soon untethered and their heads
turned in the direction of Oxford. No time was lost
in making for the Crown. It was most likely there
would be the devil to pay for that evening’s tragic work.
The law would certainly be invoked against them; indeed,
already it was in process of being summoned.
As far as the players themselves were concerned, their
chief hope was that none save Gervase Heriot had been
recognized. If that happened to be the case, and the
young man could lie perdu for a few days, the hue
and cry might pass, always provided that no evidence
was forthcoming against the members of the Lord Chamberlain’s
Company.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken as they rode to the Crown.
The minds of all were filled with a sense of vague horror.
The sinister trick they had put upon a blood-guilty
man had turned to a grim tragedy. Full many a grisly
scene had these men enacted in the process of their calling.
Full many a scene of pity and terror had the master
mind among them devised. But never in all their
play-acting had they approached the sheer horror of the
human soul which had been tormented so ruthlessly that
night.</p>

<p>It was in vain they reflected that even with his callous
crime heavy upon him they had not meant to do the man
to death. The world was undoubtedly a better place
for his quittance; it was necessary that his soul should
be wrung to its extremity if an innocent man was to
escape the ax; but let them urge in extenuation all
that was possible, and there was still not one among
them who would ever forget the dreadful thing with
which he had been face to face that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>As they rode along the moonless lanes in the stifling
silence of a midsummer night, the weird shapes of the
trees far spreading in their heavy leafage seemed to
affront their eyes with phantom shapes. The eerie darkness
that lay like a pall on the fields and woods and the
grim sentinel hedgerows oppressed them almost beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>Never once did they ease the pace of their horses,
not even to listen for sounds of pursuit. And to more
than one among that band of conspirators, perhaps most
of all to the mind of William Shakespeare, it was a real,
an unspeakable relief when a sudden bend in the dark
road showed two or three fugitive lights twinkling a little
ahead where Oxford lay.</p>

<p>Luckily, it was not a difficult matter to get through
the city gate. Still, it was necessary to knock up the
porter, who rose from his couch in no civil mood and
asked why virtuous men rode so late. But a gold angel
that was thrown to him reassured him wonderfully.</p>

<p>They came into the city unmolested. And thus far
there was never a sign of pursuit. But they had a deep
sense of relief when, at last, they turned round by the
Cornmarket and alighted under the oil lamp that had
been kept burning for them before the door of John
Davenant’s hostelry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ARFLETE was put to bed at once, and late as
was the hour a chirurgeon was sent for. He
dressed the wound, and inclined to the opinion
that the limb might be saved. But the injury was so
severe that weeks must pass before the young actor
could hope to appear again in the theater.</p>

<p>Now this accident and its consequences had filled
Shakespeare with consternation. On the Thursday following,
but six days hence, the new comedy was to be
given by the Queen’s command in Richmond Park. The
chief female character, that of <i>Rosalind</i>, had been written
and designed for this rising young actor. It was
impossible at such short notice to fill his place. There
was no other member of the company who came near
Parflete in fitness for the part. The author felt that
much depended on a graceful, slender and attractive
<i>Rosalind</i>. It was with such a personage ever in his mind
that the play had been composed for the delectation of
an exacting critic.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the full extent of the calamity
was known, Shakespeare bitterly lamented the
lack of judgment which had allowed Parflete to bear
a part in the perilous transactions of the night before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>It was vain to repine, but the playwright would now
have given much to be able to undo this grievous accident.</p>

<p>There was also another aspect of the case that filled
him with concern. Gervase Heriot had been recognized
by his uncle’s steward. The aid of the law must already
have been invoked. If the young man remained
at the Crown, it was doubtful whether his present
disguise would be a sufficient concealment, and if taken
he would certainly be charged with the murder of his
uncle. Not that that mattered particularly to one already
under sentence of death. But it might matter very much
to those who had associated themselves with the young
man in the harebrained enterprise which had ended so
disastrously.</p>

<p>Truly the reflections of William Shakespeare were not
of roseate hue this morning. Looking back on the night’s
adventure, it seemed to be as grimly fantastic as a scene
out of one of his own plays. When he had planned the
weird scene that had been enacted to the very letter of
his invention, he had had a very special object in view,
yet he had not looked to the matter to be pushed to that
extremity. It was hardly in human nature to mourn
the occurrence, for the world was undoubtedly well rid
of a bad man. Moreover, the object of the playwright’s
audacious stratagem had been achieved. He held in his
hands a paper, which even if obtained by means so irregular,
was enough to clear Gervase Heriot, always provided
that the Queen could be brought to reconsider his
case. But the feeling now uppermost in the mind of the
dramatist was one of distress. He feared that he had
drawn his companions into one of those sinister transactions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in which no man in that age could afford to be
involved.</p>

<p>Two things must be done, and they must be done
speedily. It was imperative for the Lord Chamberlain’s
players to leave Oxford at once. And an efficient substitute
for Parflete must be found immediately if the
comedy was to be given in its integrity before the Queen
on the Thursday following.</p>

<p>In the stress of these urgent matters, the playwright
took counsel of Richard Burbage. That worthy was in
the middle of a substantial if belated breakfast.</p>

<p>“In the first matter, I agree with you,” he said, upon
hearing what his colleague had to say. “There will be
security for none of us until we are out of Oxford, and
perhaps not even then. As to who is to play <i>Rosalind</i>
now that Parflete is sick, heaven help us but I know
not.”</p>

<p>“Tarbert might play the part,” said the author of the
comedy. “He has a light womanish voice, but then his
legs do not match and he has no more grace than a
soused mackerel. As I see my sweet <i>Rosalind</i>, she should
be all grace and limberness, all delicacy, tenderness and
fantasy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I grant you it would be asking too much of Tarbert,”
said the tragedian, addressing himself very seriously
to a quart of ale. “It would be asking too much
of any of us except Parflete. I am afraid, William
Shakespeare, this is going to be a sad detriment to your
play.”</p>

<p>The playwright agreed.</p>

<p>“With a good <i>Rosalind</i>,” he said, “the play might pass.
But without a good <i>Rosalind</i>, it is like to be a plaguy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>poor thing. I confess I had Parflete in my mind from
the first. The lad has not yet had scope for his talent.
He is a youth of most excellent refined wit and very neat
and comely besides. I am sure if Gloriana could but
have seen him as <i>Rosalind</i> to young Warburton’s <i>Celia</i>,
she would have been very well pleased with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and with the play, too,” said Burbage. “’Tis
a thousand pities. For between ourselves, my William,
if <i>Rosalind</i> fails us, there is mighty little substance in
our new comedy to set before such an appetite as
Gloriana’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” said the playwright, gloomily.
“And a writer is a fool who leans too heavily on a
single character. Yet I love that sweet saucy quean, but
God help us all if Tarbert plays her.”</p>

<p>“Would it offend Gloriana if you put on one of your
older pieces?”</p>

<p>“Yes, accursedly&mdash;you know that, Dick, well enough.
It is her whim to have something entirely new as a midsummer
masque, and if she is fobbed off with an old
thing, we shall none of us ever be forgiven.”</p>

<p>“‘Measure for Measure’ she has not seen.”</p>

<p>The playwright shook his head.</p>

<p>“It moves too slow for Gloriana,” he said. “It is too
much the work of the apprentice. And she’d smell out
its weakness before we were half through the first act,
for that crabbed old woman&mdash;whom God protect!&mdash;has
got the keenest nose in the realm in matters dramatical.
The old harridan is wonderful in some ways.” The tone
of the playwright was more reverent than the words it
expressed.</p>

<p>“Well, it is a plaguy ill business, William Shakespeare,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
said the tragedian, again having serious recourse
to his tankard. “A plaguy ill business altogether,
what with this affair of last night, which is very like to
land us all in the Jug, and young Parflete’s hurt, and
now this offence to Gloriana. However, it is a poor
heart that repines. ’Tis all in the great comedy, my
William, ’tis all in the great comedy. Sit ye down, man,
and cut yourself a piece of this most excellent pasty,
and I’ll call the drawer, who shall comfort you with
an honest quart of this right excellent ale.”</p>

<p>Mr. William Shakespeare, however, had little use just
now for this robust philosophy. Mutton pasties and
tankards of ale did not appeal to him this morning.
Far more serious matters were afoot.</p>

<p>At this moment, Anne Feversham chanced to enter the
inn parlor. And it was almost as if that sweetly forlorn
figure had been conjured up by the instancy of the poet’s
thoughts. She was still in her boy’s dress. Here was
the natural grace, the delicacy of limb and feature, the
perfect harmony of mind and mansion of the true <i>Rosalind</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, that shy and slender grace was the ideal of the
poet’s fancy. He knew now that it was the sight of her
in hawking dress in the tailor’s shop that had set his
mind upon the Forest of Arden. And now her presence
in that room kindled once again the eager mind. An idea
sprang into it; an idea audacious, impulsive, extravagant,
yet not wholly outside the region of the possible.</p>

<p>If only this creature, all charm and grace, could be
taught to play the part at so short a notice!</p>

<p>There was no need for the poet to put into words
that which had flashed through his brain. Nay, hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>did he need to look at Richard Burbage for his friend
to read that which was published already in a face so
expressive that it declared his lightest thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, why not?” said the playwright suddenly, without
context.</p>

<p>Burbage shook his head. He had a clear perception
of the idea that had kindled the mind of his friend, but
it was hardly to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>“Why not, I ask you?” said the playwright. “I am
sure there is a ready wit in that face, and if she has
a quick apprehension, there is no reason why she should
not learn the part in a week. Besides,”&mdash;the poet began
to pace the room in the stress of the excitement the idea
was generating in his brain&mdash;“it would be a means of
bringing her to the Queen’s notice.”</p>

<p>Richard Burbage, however, lent no countenance to
this fantastic idea. He knew Anne’s tragic story. But
he had a sufficient awe of the Queen’s displeasure to
have a grave regard for the peril of such a course.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, “I pray you dismiss so wild a
thought. No one knows better than you the temper
of the Queen. And if she took this matter amiss, it
would bode as ill for us at it would for Mistress Feversham.”</p>

<p>But already the idea had sunk deep. The playwright
was alive also to its possibilities from another point of
view. It might prove a means of gaining the Queen’s
sympathies for Gervase Heriot.</p>

<p>“Dick,” he said, “do not forget that now we hold a
proof of Mr. Heriot’s innocence. And should we adduce
it in the right season, as I have good hope of
doing, there is every reason to suppose that Gloriana,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>who at heart is a just woman, will view the matter tenderly.”</p>

<p>“I beg leave to differ from you there, William Shakespeare,”
said Burbage. “As far as I can see, there is
precious little reason to believe anything of the kind.
No one has yet fathomed the Queen’s caprices. And
it ill behooves us of all men, who exist by favor of the
public, to be mixed up in treasonable matters. Besides,
after what happened last night I for one have no longer
a stomach for them.”</p>

<p>The poet, however, was not to be deterred by these
counsels of prudence. His sympathies were too deeply
engaged. He had taken this ill-starred pair to his heart.
Assured that Gervase Heriot was the victim of a callous
conspiracy, he was fully determined not to rest now
until his wrong had been redressed.</p>

<p>Like Burbage, however, he was fully alive to the peril
of mixing in matters that could so readily be construed
as treason. And none realized more clearly than he the
danger that lurked in any affront to the Queen. Poet
as he was, and a dreamer of dreams, he owed his position
among his fellows primarily to the fact that he was
a remarkably able man of affairs. His was the vision
that could see, the wit that could mold, the tenacious
power of will that could compass the design.</p>

<p>Thus in spite of his friend’s caution, the playwright
went presently in search of Anne. Ultimately, he found
her in the inn garden sitting by the side of Gervase
Heriot, within the shade of its single yew tree. Taken
by surprise, she had barely time to disengage her arms
from about the young man’s neck, let alone to check the
tears that were flowing down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Gervase, it seemed, was bent on going to London that
day. Now that he had learned Sir John Feversham’s
peril, he felt it impossible to stay longer in hiding. To
do so would surely cause the Constable’s life to be forfeit.</p>

<p>The player did his best to reassure the young man.
Sir John’s peril was undoubtedly great, but hardly so
immediate as all that. As he had not yet been brought
to his trial, there was hardly reason to suppose that
he would have lost his head six days hence, when the
player would have the ear of the Queen.</p>

<p>At the same time, Shakespeare agreed that after the
unlucky business of the previous night, Oxford was no
place for any one of them. The sooner they quitted
it the better, since at any moment a hue and cry was
likely to be upon them. A play had to be given at two
o’clock that afternoon by the Lord Chamberlain’s servants.
But Shakespeare had already come to the conclusion
that as soon as it was at an end, the Company would
do well to lose no time in setting out for London.</p>

<p>The player now proposed that Gervase should keep
his present disguise and return that evening with the
others. Particularly anxious not to lose sight of the
young man, and hoping also to prevent his doing anything
unwise, Shakespeare entreated him to stay with
the Company and accept the hospitality of his lodging on
the Bankside until such time as his case could be brought
to the Queen’s notice.</p>

<p>Much persuasion was necessary before Gervase could
be brought to accede to this course. But when Shakespeare
gave a solemn promise that he would return to
London that evening, and that he would take care to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>keep well informed of all that related to the position of
Sir John Feversham, the young man gave a reluctant
consent. He would lie in hiding in the player’s lodging in
Southwark, until a favorable moment came to present
his case to the Queen.</p>

<p>Shakespeare was glad to have obtained this promise
from Gervase Heriot. And he then unfolded the design
that was in his mind. Having referred to Parflete’s accident
and its disastrous effect upon the new comedy which
depended so much on the part that young actor had to
play, the author made so bold as to suggest to Anne
that she should undertake the chief female character in
her boy’s dress. Nature, he said, had equipped her perfectly
for the part of <i>Rosalind</i>, if only she could
learn to play it at so short a notice. Moreover, it
would be a golden opportunity to bring her to the favorable
consideration of the Queen. Would Mistress
Feversham venture upon a task so delicate and so difficult?</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anne, “I will, indeed, if you think my
doing so may help to save the life of Gervase.”</p>

<p>She spoke with a candor, a simplicity, a decision which
told the playwright that here was a firm will and a high
courage. And such evidence removed at least half of
the risk he was about to run. One who could take such
a resolve with such a clear determination was not likely
to fail in the critical hour.</p>

<p>“Mistress,” said Shakespeare, “you shall receive instruction
at once. And if you can make yourself reasonably
perfect in the part by next Thursday, you shall
play before the Queen.”</p>

<p>Gervase, however, was strongly averse from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>scheme. Still, the event of the previous night had furnished
signal proof of the player’s wisdom. Such a
design might appear far sought, yet surely not more so
than the one which a few hours ago had been brought to
such a terrible issue.</p>

<p>Gervase, therefore, was bound to heed the proposal.
And, after all, the most grievous of his many misgivings
were those concerning the fate of Anne herself. In
the event of his own sentence being carried out, she was
determined to die, too. Even if now he went to London
to give himself up, her whole mind was set on accompanying
him. All that dissuasion could do had
failed to move her from that clear design. Wherever
he went she would go with him, even into eternity
itself.</p>

<p>In the end, it was perhaps the resolved attitude of
Anne that enabled Shakespeare to get his way. And,
after all, if she had the courage to embrace a plan so
desperate, it was hardly for Gervase to dissent.</p>

<p>And she, it seemed, with a strange faith discerned
some slender hope in it. Such a faith could only spring
out of the depths of her despair. But with the dauntless
courage that had carried her through everything,
she began at once to bring the whole force of her will
to bear on the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Little as she knew of the man who had made this
singular proposal, she could not remain insensible to his
personality. It appealed to her in a subtle way. This
man, with his gentle voice and face of sad expressiveness,
had masked depths of power that few men and fewer
women were able to resist.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the luckless fugitives came to yield
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>themselves to the player’s care. Their pass was desperate,
indeed. Whatever happened now could not
make it worse. God knew, the expedient offered was
forlorn enough, but for the sake of the slender hope
it bore, they would submit themselves entirely to this
man’s hands.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>S if to lend color to Shakespeare’s fears, he was
soon to hear disquieting news. Finding himself
in the course of the morning in the tavern
parlor, he overheard the conversation of those
assembled there. A sturdy yeoman, it seemed, was
full of information concerning a murder that had
been committed during the night at the Grange,
the house of Mr. Simon Heriot, along the Banbury
Road.</p>

<p>“They do say that Mr. Heriot himself has had his
throat cut by his own nephew,” said the bearer of the
news.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” sharply interposed a man who
sat in the corner drinking his morning flagon.</p>

<p>The man was Grisewood. Instantly, he was all attention
and alertness.</p>

<p>The countryman repeated his story, to be sure with
a number of embellishments that were very wide of
the truth. But the essential fact was there, that Simon
Heriot had been done to death by his nephew in the
course of the previous night.</p>

<p>Grisewood’s interest was very great. He knew as a
fact that Gervase Heriot was close at hand, and that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>had a powerful motive for taking even a course so desperate
as the murdering of his uncle.</p>

<p>“Has the nephew been arrested?” asked Grisewood,
with an excitement he did not attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not taken yet,” said the news-bearer. “But
he will be precious soon, else call me a rogue. They
do say that young villain lies here in Oxford, but I’ll
wager Justice Pretyman and his posse will mighty soon
rout him out o’ this home o’ learnin’.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil is Justice Pretyman?”</p>

<p>“The Justice is a great man hereabouts. There’s none
better than he at tracking down the evil doer. I passed
him and his men along the road as I came up. They are
going to search every tavern and alehouse in this city
from cellar to attic for this wicked young man, Gervase
Heriot.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s luck to their errand,” said Grisewood,
piously, draining his tankard.</p>

<p>In the next moment, plunged in deep thought, he left
the tavern parlor. Shakespeare soon left the parlor also.</p>

<p>This news was very disquieting to the player. He was
in such a state of grave uneasiness, that he could have
wished to start from Oxford immediately. But it would
not be possible to do this until the Lord Chamberlain’s
men had given their final performance that afternoon.
Therefore he must possess his soul in patience until that
time, but also he must be fully alive to all contingencies.
Of one circumstance he was ignorant, and well it was
for his peace of mind that this was the case. He did
not know that Grisewood had penetrated the disguise of
the Italian music master.</p>

<p>Happily, there was no reason to suppose that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>dead man’s steward had associated the members of the
Lord Chamberlain’s Company with the tragedy of the
previous night. At least, as yet there was no evidence
of this fact. But the playwright felt they must be
prepared for all untoward things that might befall.</p>

<p>Fortune was kind, inasmuch that the officers of the
law did not pay their visit to the Crown Tavern before
the final performance had taken place. Indeed, as luck
would have it, they went away at first on a false scent
as far as the neighboring town of Banbury, so that by the
time they found their way to the Cornmarket the play
was over, the audience had dispersed, and the members
of the Company were about to sit down to a well-earned
meal.</p>

<p>As was sometimes their habit in such circumstances,
they had not troubled to change their clothes. The
principal players were thus arrayed with the magnificence
of gallants and courtiers. And a little group of
these sat sunning themselves outside the tavern door,
waiting patiently for the summons to the board within,
when Justice Pretyman and his posse made their long-expected
appearance.</p>

<p>It was well that Shakespeare had already informed
Burbage and Kemp, and one or two of the others, that
this untoward visit was to be expected. Thus, as soon
as the officers of the law came into view, the quick-witted
playwright was ready to meet the situation.</p>

<p>A shrewd observer of men and things does not take
long to find out what a man is worth. And a glance
at Justice Pretyman was enough to assure the dramatist
that he might have stood for the prototype of Justice
Shallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>The magistrate arrived with a number of sheriff’s
men. And he was armed with an authority to enter
and search every likely place in the city and county
of Oxford which might harbor the notorious traitor,
Gervase Heriot, who had not only broken out of prison,
but who had also murdered his uncle the previous
night.</p>

<p>John Davenant had been told beforehand of Justice
Pretyman’s coming. Therefore he met him at the inn
door. And the demand that a house of such repute
should be searched for so dark a purpose appeared to
fill the heart of the worthy vintner with grief and consternation.</p>

<p>“You may search my tavern, sir,” he said, “but I
would have you to know that, upon my honor as a
licensed victualler, this is the most reputable tavern betwixt
here and The Pump in Aldgate.”</p>

<p>“That I don’t doubt, sir,” said Justice Pretyman, with
official asperity.</p>

<p>He was a pompous, overbearing little man, very conscious
of the dignity to which it had pleased Providence
to call him.</p>

<p>“As <i>custos rotulorum</i> of this country, as one armed
with the Queen’s authority&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, God protect her,” suddenly interposed a man
who stood by in a voice of fervent piety. “But I would
beg you, sir, to abate all instancy of demeanor and likewise
all of the same on the part of your bumpkins,
whom I doubt not are excellent fellows in the right place
and season, but who at this moment will best serve
the Queen by bearing themselves with all the modesty
they can command.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>The man who had ventured these somewhat haughty
remarks was dressed in a cloak of plum-colored velvet
and a feathered hat, of such style and dimension as is
seldom seen out of a court. He had come up with an
air of nonchalant ease, and had interposed his remarks
in a manner which seemed to claim for them the highest
possible consideration.</p>

<p>At the opprobrious term “Bumpkin,” it had been on
the tip of Justice Pretyman’s tongue to retort, “Bumpkin
yourself, sir.” He was a hotheaded little man, also
he was vain, also he was very self-important. But he
was thwarted in this natural desire by the very patent
fact that whatever else this haughty personage was, he
was evidently not a bumpkin.</p>

<p>Now Justice Pretyman was a small gentleman, who
would like to have been thought a great gentleman. And
those who are thus afflicted, however much they may
browbeat their inferiors, however much they may ruffle
it among their equals, are of all men particularly wary
when it comes to a question of their superiors.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of Providence, it chanced that before
Justice Pretyman was able to make the proper, necessary
and entirely satisfactory rejoinder of “Bumpkin
yourself, sir!” his small, birdlike eye lit upon the plum-colored
cloak and the hat with the feather, and further,
it caught a glimpse of a wonderful doublet of black satin
barred with yellow. Therefore, was his rejoinder reduced
from “Bumpkin yourself, sir!” to “I beg your
pardon, sir,” with as little in the way of asperity and as
much in the way of dignity as he could command.</p>

<p>The personage in the plum-colored cloak smiled with
a benign gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“If you are upon the Queen’s business, sir,” he said,
“heaven forefend that I of all men should come between
you and your high and honorable occasions. But, to
be plain with you, I am bound to say you and your
ragged robins have come here in a plaguy ill season.”</p>

<p>“Od’s life, sir!”</p>

<p>The hand of Justice Pretyman strayed involuntarily
to the hilt of his sword. But again his eye caught the
plum-colored cloak, and he thought the better of the
matter.</p>

<p>“I have written and signed authority,” he said, “to
search this house for one Gervase Heriot, a notorious
traitor, and that is a course I am determined to follow.”</p>

<p>The man in the plum-colored cloak lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“If such is your intention, sir, by all means pursue
it,” he said. “But, before you do so, there is a matter
of grave concern with which you will do well to make
yourself acquainted. Perhaps, Master Davenant”&mdash;he
turned to the innkeeper&mdash;“you will have the goodness
to inform this gentleman of the matter in question?”</p>

<p>Mine host demurred in a manner of obsequious reverence.</p>

<p>“God forbid, sir, that I should expound the matter
to the worshipful justice when you yourself are by,” he
said, in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>“As you will,” said the man in the plum-colored cloak.
“The fact of the matter is, sir,” he said, turning to
Justice Pretyman, who by this time was fully primed for
some startling announcement, “a certain lady who is of
the highest&mdash;I may say of the very highest&mdash;consideration
has just arrived at this inn on her way to the north,
and is lying here one night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Justice Pretyman nodded with the gravity of a man
who fully grasps the significance of such a piece of news.</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir,” he said. “Is that the case? And may
I presume, sir, to ask the name of this personage?”</p>

<p>The man in the plum-colored cloak laid a finger to his
lip.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Master Prettyfellow,” he said, “but your
style and assemblance assure me that you are not unacquainted
with the Court. Correct me if I err.”</p>

<p>Justice Pretyman did not correct him.</p>

<p>“And that being the case, I have the less compunction
in withholding the name of the high personage who, at
this moment, sheds upon this humble roof-tree the lively
radiance of her presence. Master Prettyfellow, you take
me, I trow and trust. You understand me, Master Prettyfellow?”
The man in the plum-colored cloak laid a confidential
hand upon the Justice’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“By God’s life, I take you, sir.” A subtle but delightful
sense of flattery had been engendered in the little
peacock’s brain. “That is, I think I take you. It is&mdash;that
is&mdash;she is&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man in the plum-colored cloak checked the threatened
indiscretion of Justice Pretyman with an uplifted
and much-bejeweled hand.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Master Prettyfellow!” He gazed
around him apprehensively. “We are in danger of being
overheard.”</p>

<p>For this surmise, the man in the plum-colored cloak
had full warrant without a doubt. Others, attired with
a flamboyance and a glitter that went well with his own,
were standing a little apart. And their almost excessive
gravity of manner could not disguise the fact that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>had both ears and eyes for all that was going forward.</p>

<p>There was one, however, who watched this play with
a sour smile. He was a man more sober in dress, but
whose attire was yet that of a person of quality. He
stood quite apart from all the rest, and carried his arm
in a sling. The look on his face clearly showed that
he, too, had ears and eyes for all that was taking place.
Moreover, he stroked his chin with an air of grim but
deeply pensive satisfaction.</p>

<p>“If you are determined to have search made of this
tavern, Master Prettyfellow,” said the man in the plum-colored
cloak, “it is not for me to gainsay you. But I
am sure you will readily understand how necessary it
is that this matter should be pursued with the utmost
decorum.”</p>

<p>“Sir, that I do promise,” said Justice Pretyman.</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the man in the plum-colored cloak,
“with the utmost decorum. And as I understand, you
have figured at Court, Master Prettyfellow”&mdash;here the
voice was raised to a level that drew the attention of
the group near by&mdash;“And, as I understand, you have
figured at Court, Master Prettyfellow”&mdash;the words were
impressively repeated.</p>

<p>“You may take it, sir, that I have.” The tone of Justice
Pretyman was full of dignity.</p>

<p>“I am very glad indeed to hear that.” The man in
the plum-colored cloak spoke with a sudden accession of
feeling. “I cannot tell you how glad I am to hear that.
Now there will not be the least difficulty about the whole
matter. I will send in your name at once to this most
distinguished lady, who must remain without one. My
lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>George Taylor and William Kemp, arrayed in the
robes of the theater, stepped forward together in answer
to this summons. Such zeal, however, in nowise
embarrassed the man in the plum-colored cloak.</p>

<p>“My lord duke”&mdash;he turned to William Kemp&mdash;“will
you have the good kindness to take in the name of Master
Prettyfellow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pretyman,” corrected the justice, beginning, however,
to perspire freely.</p>

<p>The officious provincial was not a little uncertain as
to the ground upon which he stood. Judging by the demeanor
of these gayly-attired gentlemen and the high
tone that went with it, he began to fear that the Queen
herself had arrived at the Crown Tavern. And his vanity
having allowed him to claim a familiarity with the
Court when he had never been there in his life, he had
merely to be received in audience by her to incur the
risk of a grave exposure.</p>

<p>“One moment, sir,” he said, desperately. “If this
unknown lady is the high personage I take her to be, I
have no desire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But William Kemp, in his ducal trappings, was already
away on his errand.</p>

<p>Justice Pretyman felt the situation to be growing desperate.
And, to make matters worse, the man in the
cloak was fain to misread his attitude of mind.</p>

<p>“I have not the least doubt, sir,” he said, “that if this
lady&mdash;whom we shall both do well not to name more
explicitly&mdash;is informed that you are familiar with the
Court, she will gladly give you an audience, although
you must please remember she travels incognito.”</p>

<p>By this time Justice Pretyman was fully convinced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>that it was the Queen herself who was lying one night
at the Crown Tavern.</p>

<p>“You mistake me, sir,” he said, desperately. “I never
said that I was familiar with the Court.”</p>

<p>“You never said you were familiar with the Court,
sir!” The man in the plum-colored cloak was the picture
of polite indignation. “But, ods my life, sir! this
is a very grave matter.”</p>

<p>Justice Pretyman thought so, too. At least, his perspiring
red face belied him if he did not.</p>

<p>“How I wish, sir,” said the man in the plum-colored
cloak, “you had had the grace to make yourself more explicit.
This lady is a bad one to cross, as all the world
very well knows.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am aware of that,” said Justice Pretyman,
beginning already to wish himself well out of the
affair.</p>

<p>The richly caparisoned figure of William Kemp
emerged with slow dignity from the tavern interior. He
bent to the ear of the man in the plum-colored cloak.
A good deal of confidential whispering followed, of which
Justice Pretyman could only catch the ominous words,
“Her Grace.”</p>

<p>But it was the man in the plum-colored cloak who
addressed the uneasy magistrate.</p>

<p>“The fact of the matter is, sir,” he said, “this lady
does not remember your name, but she hopes she may
remember your face. She is not unwilling to grant you
an audience of five minutes, but&mdash;strictly between ourselves&mdash;if
you will take the advice of a friend, you will
think twice before you run any risk of incurring her
august displeasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Justice Pretyman’s mind certainly seemed to recognize
the wisdom of this sage counsel. And the result of
a very little deliberation on his part was that he gathered
his men and made off down the street with the least
possible delay, leaving the members of the Lord Chamberlain’s
Company to enjoy the triumph of their audacity.</p>

<p>To be sure, they little knew on how slender a thread
it hung. Not ten yards from them, during the whole
time in which this comedy had been played, a man stood
marking sourly every phase of the proceedings. He
could have undone them with a word.</p>

<p>The word, however, was not spoken. Grisewood
judged the hour to be not yet. Still, he had marked
very closely all that had passed. And he had been at
pains to make himself fully acquainted with the matter in
all its details. There and then, he could have laid his
finger on the man these blundering rustics sought. But
that would not have suited his purpose at the moment.
For he was too astute not to realize the immense advantage
his knowledge gave him, and far too cunning
not to be fully determined to take some high profit out
of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>O time was lost now in moving out of Oxford.
Within an hour of Justice Pretyman’s visit, the
Lord Chamberlain’s men were on their way to
London. They were accompanied by Gervase and Anne,
who were still disguised as the Italian music master
and his son, and also by the falconer, John Markham.
None of them was aware that, less than a mile behind,
rode Sir Robert Grisewood and his two servants.</p>

<p>The players traveled that night as far as Reading,
where they lay, and reached Southwark without misadventure
in the course of the following afternoon, which
was Sunday. Shakespeare felt a keen sense of relief
when he had placed the fugitives in the comfort and
security of his lodgings on the Bankside, which he shared
with his friend Burbage.</p>

<p>The tragedian, on his own part, it must be confessed,
was terrible uneasy of mind. He knew the situation
to be one of great peril and difficulty. And he viewed
with a feeling little short of horror Shakespeare’s determination
to concern himself with a matter of high treason.
He had a deep pity for the fugitives, but he felt
how futile and how perilous it was for men such as
themselves to mingle in their sinister affairs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>
<p>Parflete had been left at Oxford, as he was in no
condition to travel. And over the question of a substitute
for that unlucky young actor, the author and the
manager came to the verge of a quarrel. Shakespeare
kept to his determination that Anne should play <i>Rosalind</i>
in the new comedy, while Burbage affirmed that
it was contrary to all precedent and was courting disaster.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, the author began at once
to instruct Anne in the part. And she brought to her
study a keenness of grasp and a quickness of apprehension
that delighted her mentor. Her progress was very
rapid under his wise guidance. In two days, she was
almost word perfect. Moreover, she discovered a natural
faculty for acting which she shared in common with
her sex. All her gestures were simple, unforced, appropriate;
and her bearing had an ease and grace that
Parflete himself could not have equaled.</p>

<p>The author was delighted. It was in vain that Richard
Burbage shook his head and indulged in all manner
of dark prophecy. Here was the perfect <i>Rosalind</i>. Besides,
there lay behind this project a higher and deeper
motive than even the pleasuring of the first lady in the
land.</p>

<p>Never for an instant was there absent from a noble
and humane mind an intense desire to serve these hapless
children of destiny. William Shakespeare was determined
at all hazards to arouse the Queen’s interest
on their behalf, and if possible to excite her pity. Yet
none knew better than this supreme judge of human kind
the peril and the difficulty of such a task. The Queen
was a woman of dangerous and vindictive temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>But Shakespeare was pledged to do all that lay in his
power to save the lives of these fugitives. Burbage
and Kemp and Heming, and others of his colleagues,
might be full of alarm for the consequences likely to
attend his interference, but they were powerless to turn
him from his purpose. The matter had become a point of
honor with him now.</p>

<p>In accordance with the promise made to Gervase,
Shakespeare kept himself fully informed in regard to
Sir John Feversham. On the morning following his return
to London, the playwright went to Greenwich to
the Queen’s palace, and there sought an interview with
a man with whom he was on terms of intimacy, who held
high office in the Royal Household. From him he learned
that the Constable was held a close prisoner in the Tower,
that the Court of Star Chamber had condemned him
already to the block, but that there was good reason
to believe the sentence would not be carried out for
another week at least, since Cecil, the Queen’s all-powerful
minister, felt it was not a case for undue haste.</p>

<p>The high official with whom William Shakespeare conferred
shook his head sadly over the whole matter. It
was very ugly, he said, and was strongly inclined to
deprecate the player’s interest in it. He gave him a
word of advice. Let him dismiss the subject from his
thoughts as soon as possible. It was one of those dark
things in which no man who set a value upon his life
and liberty could afford to concern himself.</p>

<p>The man to whom this excellent advice was given well
knew that it was sound enough. But he was pledged
too deeply; besides, he was not a man to count the cost.
He bore the news back to Gervase, who was fretting out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>his heart in his hiding-place in the player’s lodging on the
Bankside, and told him he could possess his soul in patience,
at least, until Thursday.</p>

<p>The three intervening days were fraught with much
anxiety for Shakespeare. The fate of the new comedy
hung in the balance. The absence of Parflete from the
cast was felt by all, except the author himself, to be an
irreparable blow to its prospects. And the announcement
that the all-important part of <i>Rosalind</i> was to be intrusted
to one who had absolutely no experience of the
theater filled the other players with dismay.</p>

<p>Burbage alone knew the true identity of the Italian
music master’s son. And even in such a crisis as this,
he was too loyal to his friend to make others a party
to his knowledge. But the great actor was sorely uneasy.
His misgivings were many, not only as to the fate
of the comedy, but also as to that of the author himself,
now that he had taken this unlucky resolve to concern
himself with treason.</p>

<p>A rehearsal of the play was called for Tuesday afternoon.
And here a surprise awaited those who were
prophesying disaster. Complete tyro as the young Signor
Arrigo was known to be, his impersonation of <i>Rosalind</i>
showed a most surprising talent. Anne had been strung
up to a high pitch of excitement. She brought all her
high courage and her quick woman’s faculties to bear
upon the task and the result was far beyond all expectation.
There was no denying such grace, such beauty,
such natural aptitude. Not once did she falter in her
lines. And then the voice was so clear and musical, that
it might have been that of <i>Rosalind</i> herself.</p>

<p>Indeed, had not the other players known the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span><i>Rosalind</i> to be the Italian music master’s son, they must
have been convinced that she was a woman! They were
bound to agree with the author that young Signor Arrigo
was born to play the part. And their spirits rose accordingly.
Even the staunchest adherents of Parflete were
compelled to admit that fortune had provided them with
a substitute of quite remarkable powers. That gifted
young player himself could not have surpassed the new
<i>Rosalind</i>.</p>

<p>It was only promise, to be sure. Let them withhold
the verdict until Thursday. These were men of experience,
who knew that the happy augury of the rehearsal
was not always borne out by the performance
itself. But they were put in excellent heart by the brilliant
aptitude of the young Signor Arrigo, which so far
transcended their expectations. John Heming, one of the
Company’s managers, a man of parts with a well-developed
faculty of criticism, was particularly delighted. He
had never seen such a precocious genius for the stage.
And he could not help admiring the perspicacity which
had enabled the author to take a step so bold, which had
led to a discovery of such importance.</p>

<p>All now promised well for the momentous day. If the
new <i>Rosalind</i> fulfilled the promise of the first rehearsal,
there need be no fears for the success of the piece. The
author had yet to know failure. It was true the subject-matter
of the new comedy might be flimsy enough,
but Burbage and Heming declared, and these were men
of ripe judgment, that it had all the qualities which had
made the playwright famous.</p>

<p>Still, before that fateful Thursday dawned, there happened
a sinister thing. Late in the evening of Wednesday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Shakespeare returned alone to his lodgings. He had
been ceaselessly occupied during the day with the final
preparations for the morrow. Everything was now in
readiness for the journey to Richmond, a few hours
hence. The playwright was feeling dog-tired and had a
longing for rest, as he turned the key in the door of his
dwelling.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find a light showing through the
shutters of the little parlor in which he wrote and read.
The room, it was true, had been placed at the service
of Heriot and Mistress Feversham. But the hour was so
late, that he had supposed they had retired long ago to
their rest.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this was the case. But when the
playwright entered the parlor, he found a man sitting
there in expectation of his arrival. It was a warm evening
of July, but the face and the form of the visitor
were hidden in the folds of a voluminous cloak.</p>

<p>The unbidden guest, whoever he might be, received
Shakespeare coolly enough. He did not even take the
trouble to rise from his chair when the poet came into
the room, but merely held up his hand as if to imply
a need of caution and secrecy, and then in a tone of
studied insolence told him to close the door.</p>

<p>Shakespeare was quick to recognize the voice of his
visitor. The man was Sir Robert Grisewood.</p>

<p>“To what is due this honor?” said the poet with a
courtesy that was deeply ironical.</p>

<p>He knew well enough that his visitor was not likely
to be inspired by any good motive. But long ago he
had taken the measure of the man, and he did not fear
him in the least. Indeed, for that matter, he feared no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>man, but with that prudence which springs from an intimate
knowledge of the world, he was at once upon his
guard.</p>

<p>“You do well to ask that question, my friend,” said
Grisewood, unmuffling his face in order that Shakespeare
not only might see it, but that he might also be disconcerted
by the sight of it.</p>

<p>“What is your business with me, Sir Robert Grisewood?”
said Shakespeare, coldly and contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I will tell you.” The eyes of the unwelcome visitor
were full of menace. “I will tell you in a very few
words, good Master Actor and Versifier. Your precious
life is not worth five minutes’ purchase.”</p>

<p>The dramatist was wholly unaffected by the announcement.</p>

<p>“That may be so,” he said, coldly. And he gave his
shoulders a shrug, which implied that the information
was of very little consequence.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you why it is not?”</p>

<p>“As you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, to be brief and round with you, good Master
Poet, the whole of your doings, your exits and your
entrances, as you would say, of the past fortnight are
perfectly well known to me. And I would fain inform
you that, at this moment, you are harboring under this
roof the notorious traitor, Gervase Heriot, and also the
young daughter of Sir John Feversham, who conspired
with him to break prison.”</p>

<p>Grisewood had the air of one who looses a thunderbolt.
But if he looked for the dire effect, which may
reasonably be expected to attend such a Jove-like feat,
he must have been sadly disappointed. The man to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>whom his words were addressed showed not the least
sign of fear.</p>

<p>“All that you say is true enough,” said the playwright,
“if it is any satisfaction to you to know it.”</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy on that score, my friend,”
said Grisewood sourly. “It is a very considerable satisfaction
to me to know it.”</p>

<p>“And I presume you would gain a profit from your
knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master Actor, to be brief and round with you,
that is certainly my intention. And further, I would
inform you that the reward I have in my mind is not
one to be despised. Because you will do well to understand
that I have ample evidence to implicate you and
your fellow-players in the murder of my friend, Mr.
Simon Heriot, who was foully done to death in his own
house in the course of last Friday night.”</p>

<p>“In other words, Sir Robert Grisewood,” said Shakespeare,
with a biting coldness that seemed to exasperate
his visitor, “you propose to take profit from the murder
of your friend.”</p>

<p>“Have a care, you ranting, play-acting swine!”</p>

<p>Although one hand of the bully was done up in bandages,
the other instinctively sought the hilt of his sword.
But this action did nothing to modify the stern contempt
of the actor.</p>

<p>“You are here, Sir Robert Grisewood, to seek a price
for your silence?”</p>

<p>The tone seemed to bite like an acid.</p>

<p>“Yes, my friend, that assumption is a true one, and I
propose to fix just as heavy a price as you can afford
to pay. And as I understand your penny peep-show
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>tricks are making you a fortune, the sum I intend to
exact shall not be unworthy of your figure in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to the sum of a thousand pounds,
good Master Playwright and maker of verses?”</p>

<p>Less of disdain than of pity entered the face of the
poet.</p>

<p>“The sum seems little enough,” he said, “for the deed
it would purchase.”</p>

<p>“Aye, little enough, Master Moralist, as you say, but
still a fairly substantial figure for those who have to
earn it by the sweat of their brains. And, of course,”
Grisewood added with an ugly sneer, “other opportunities
may arise of adding to the price of my silence, since you
incline to think it too little.”</p>

<p>“I think it neither too little nor too much,” said the
playwright. “For, to be as frank with you, Sir Robert,
as you have been with me, I care so little for your
silence, that I would not stoop to buy it if even a single
word were its price.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, my friend, you shall hang at Tyburn.”</p>

<p>The blackmailer rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“I promise you,” he said, and his eyes were those of
a beast of prey, “my first business to-morrow shall be
to seek out my Lord Burleigh. The whole of the information
I possess shall be laid before him, and you can
depend upon it, my friend, you and your infernal company,
upon being lodged in jail as soon as your precious
interlude has been performed before the Queen. It will
be a pleasant guerdon to look forward to, will it not?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>
<p>Grisewood realized already that his choice scheme had
fallen to the ground. He saw at once that he had
counted on too much. He had looked for an easy prey.
This highly strung, emotional temperament would yield
readily to his threats. It would be easy enough to
frighten the very life out of what was doubtless a craven’s
heart.</p>

<p>The knowledge that he was now free to do his worst,
and that in Shakespeare’s opinion the worst he could
do was of such little account as to be a subject of his open
scorn, filled him with fury. Also he was amazed at the
utter indifference of the fellow. He had the power, as he
firmly believed, to take away this man’s life, and yet this
half hackney-writer, half merry-andrew was too proud
to sue for his life with civility, let alone to pay for it
with current coin of the realm.</p>

<p>Grisewood withdrew with a snarl and a sneer. The
morrow should see them all lodged in “The Jug.” Within
a month from that day, he would answer for it that the
noose should be round their necks.</p>

<p>He swaggered out of the house on to the Bankside.
Here his two servants joined him, for at that hour of
the night it was unsafe for any man to be abroad unattended.
Thinking his ugly thoughts, he walked slowly
in the direction of the Falcon stairs. There he hailed
the waterman, who was awaiting him with a wherry to
bear him to his own lodging in a more aristocratic quarter
of the town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE morning of the great day broke mistily, with
a promise of summer glory. Poor unhappy
Anne, lodged in a cool and clean chamber overlooking
the river, was awake at the first peep of
dawn. Her few hours of sleep had been terribly disturbed.
She awoke with a start and sprang out of
bed as soon as the light touched her eyelids. Only too
well did she know that further sleep would not be for
her.</p>

<p>Yes, the dread day was come. It might be the last
she would know of liberty. Nay, it was most likely.
And it was the day on which the fate of Gervase would
be irrevocably sealed.</p>

<p>She dare not give her mind to the grim matter, which,
asleep or awake, encompassed it. Dressing in a fever
of haste, as if she feared to be overtaken by the thoughts
she dare not face, she went out of doors into the keen
morning air. She walked up and down by the banks of
the mist-enveloped river, and in the hope of composing
her over-wrought mind, she began to repeat the lines of
her part.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was aware that a figure was emerging
dimly from the mists ahead. It was that of a man. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>moment afterwards she had recognized the author of
“As You Like It.”</p>

<p>The playwright came toward her. He too had slept
but little. And in that somber and wonderful face was
a haggard weariness that made the soul of the girl recoil.
It was the face of a man besieged and tormented by a
thousand devils; of a man who had never known a moment
of peace in this life, and who hardly looked to
know it in the life to come.</p>

<p>Not so much as a word of greeting passed between
them. But as the player saw the face of young and
delicate fairness, seared already by the anguish of the
soul, he placed a hand on the girl’s shoulder with a gentleness
of pity that meant very much more than speech.</p>

<p>“Be of good courage, mistress,” that gesture seemed
to say.</p>

<p>Without speaking a word, the player passed on like a
wraith into the mists that hung as a pall upon the river.</p>

<p>Gervase also was early abroad. He too had slept
little. Seated at the window of his room, brooding
with a sick heart on the chances of his fate, he had
seen Anne go forth, so that presently he followed her.</p>

<p>For long enough they walked together, and for the
last time as they believed. A few hours hence all would
be decided. And in their hearts their hope of life and
perhaps their desire of it was very slender.</p>

<p>Their sufferings of the past few weeks had been bitter.
This morning they were overborne. Whatever fate held
in store for them now they felt they had reached the
nadir of the soul.</p>

<p>Soon after nine o’clock that morning the Lord Chamberlain’s
servants embarked in two of the royal barges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>that had been placed at their disposal. The progress
was slow but comfortable, and by noon of a glorious
July day they had come to the palace at Richmond. All
the players, with one exception, from the most important
to the humblest member of the Company, betrayed
evidences of anxiety and nervousness. William Shakespeare
alone was so cool and collected that the occasion
might have been of the most ordinary kind.</p>

<p>Those few among the players who shared the dark
secret which was to make this day so memorable in
the life of the author of the new comedy, were astonished
by a calmness that was to them unnatural.
And they could not help marveling how a man whose
very life depended on the whim of a harsh-tempered
and capricious woman should be able to mask his
thoughts and to control his feelings in a manner so remarkable.</p>

<p>The terraces of the palace which overlooked the beautiful
park in which it stood were thronging already with
a mob of gallants and court ladies. Their wonderful
clothes gave a very second-rate air to the tawdry finery
affected by most of the players. Even the cloak of
Shakespeare himself erred a little, but that was on the
side of modesty.</p>

<p>One young fop was quick to turn this fact to account.
Having a reputation for wit, and being surrounded by
those in whose eyes he had an ambition to shine, he
gravely accosted the actor. He removed his plumed hat
with a sweeping gesture and made a low bow.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, in a loud voice
which attracted general notice. “Pray excuse the liberty
I take in addressing you, but I admire the style of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>your cloak so much that I would fain ask the name of
your tailor.”</p>

<p>In spite of the audible tittering of fine ladies and the
delighted guffaws of gallant gentlemen, the playwright
showed the perfect unconcern of one who has his own
private standard of men and things. He did not reply,
but quietly looked the impertinent coxcomb up and down
as if he were a new species of animal with whom he was
not yet acquainted.</p>

<p>The fop was nettled by this nonchalance.</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” he said impudently. “Give me your tailor’s
name I pray you, in order that I may have the great
felicity of taking the air in a cloak exactly its fellow.”</p>

<p>The playwright shook his head with an air of polite
deprecation.</p>

<p>“I have too kindly a feeling toward an honest craftsman,”
he said.</p>

<p>“God’s death, sir! what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sir,” said the player, “that I would not like
so good a fellow to run the double risk of a bad debt and
an even worse advertisement.”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter followed from those who had gathered
at the pleasant prospect of a little player-baiting
by an accredited wag. Many there were about the Court
who were by no means well-disposed toward players in
general. These actors were claiming far too much attention
from those in high places. Their continually growing
favor was beginning to be a matter of concern to
those whose own existence depended so largely on the
indulgence of the great.</p>

<p>But the fop was completely taken aback by the player’s
rejoinder. For the moment he did not know how to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>reply. He had not expected to be held up to ridicule
in that place of all others by an humble individual who
had not the least pretensions to fashion. But the laugh
had gone against him heavily. And being in reality a dull
and commonplace fellow enough, in the end he took
refuge in round abuse of “those common jays who would
peacock it among their betters.”</p>

<p>“Pray, my lord, on what ground do you hold yourself
to be the superior of this gentleman?” suddenly
interposed a harsh and imperious voice.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the Queen. The group of gallants
and fine ladies had been too much occupied with the
sport that was afoot to notice who it was who had come
into their midst.</p>

<p>My lord’s confusion was great. And it was not made
less by the look of sour disdain which animated the features
of his sovereign.</p>

<p>This old raddled woman in farcical clothes and an
auburn wig was by no means a fool. She had lived too
long in the world and had mingled too freely with the
very best the age had to give not to be an uncommonly
shrewd judge of things and men. She had the
rough commonsense which is a far better equipment
than subtlety when it comes to dealings with human
nature.</p>

<p>“Well, my lord, on what grounds I ask you?”</p>

<p>“On the ground of birth, your grace,” said the fop,
who by now had time to collect himself a little.</p>

<p>The Queen’s lip curled contemptuously.</p>

<p>“A man who takes refuge in that,” she said, “can have
little merit of his own, my lord. And to my mind a man
is twice a fool who, being born to opportunity, can turn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>it to no better advantage. How say you, Master Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“There are those who hold, your grace,” said the
player in his deep and musical voice, “that it is better
to be a fool of pedigree than to be a sage without gules
or quarterings.”</p>

<p>The Queen laughed. But the ready independence of
the player’s answer pleased her as much as it surprised
her courtiers. There was not one among them who
would have ventured it. There was not one among them
who was not unduly eager to acquiesce in any opinion
that might be expressed by this august lady.</p>

<p>It was not the Queen’s habit to unbend easily. She
held the exaggerated Tudor view of the status of the
sovereign. Her court was expected to approach her
on bended knee and there were many supple backs in
consequence. But there was not a trace of the sycophant
about this man who conversed with her as modestly,
as readily and as easily as he would have done
with a lounger in a tavern. And while the gallants and
fine ladies were not a little shocked by the unaffectedness
of the man’s bearing and marveled not a little
that one so august should bestow so much notice upon a
common play-actor, the Queen, on the other hand, seemed
almost to forget for the moment the dizzy eminence to
which it had pleased Providence to call her.</p>

<p>The truth was she dearly loved what she called “a
man.” And this was a scarce commodity in the exotic
atmosphere which surrounded Elizabeth Tudor. Few
there were who dared to hold opinions of their own,
let alone to advance them with the unstudied assurance
of this man of lowly calling, who was yet not wholly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>unmindful of the fact that he was absolute monarch
of an empire more imperial than Gloriana’s own.</p>

<p>To be sure, none of those present realized that fact.
Nor was it realized by the Queen herself. Her mind
was strong and shrewd rather than deep and subtle. It
was the player’s independence of judgment and the
clear yet perfectly modest and simple manner by which
he gave it expression which made such an appeal to her.</p>

<p>It was a sad sight for many an astonished and resentful
eye to observe the Queen and the man “Shakescene”&mdash;it
is a foible of the great to affect a becoming
uncertainty in regard to the names of humbler mortals&mdash;walking
quite apart from all the rest, up one alley
and down another, talking and laughing heartily upon
terms which perilously approached equality. What the
Queen’s majesty had in common with the merry-andrew
in the barred cloak passed the comprehension of all.
But the harsh and strident laugh of the royal lady, not
unworthy of a raven with a sore throat, could be heard
continually. Many a diligent courtier who had spent
the flower of his years in waiting humbly upon the
Queen’s pleasure without having anything very substantial
in the way of preferment to show for it, was cut
to the soul.</p>

<p>And it was not here that the scandal ended. A little
later when the Queen dined a place was set for the man
Shakescene at her own table. And many a lisping, lily-white
gentleman narrowly observed the demeanor of this
upstart whose homely style and unaffected air offered
so wide a target for their criticism.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y two o’clock that afternoon all was in readiness
for the performance of the new comedy before
Gloriana and her Court. A pavilion had been
raised in the middle of one of the great lawns, in order
that the spectators might be shielded from the sunshine
which beat fiercely from a cloudless July heaven. At the
edge of the lawn was a thicket of fine trees and heather,
a veritable Forest of Arden in miniature. From the
depths of this glade emerged the performers in this woodland
pastoral.</p>

<p>It was a great ordeal for Anne. On an occasion of far
less importance she might have been overcome by fear.
But now she was strung up almost to the breaking point.
So grave was her pass and so much was at stake that a
supreme call was made upon her will. And she responded
nobly. No human being could have exercised a greater
power of mind or brought a finer resolution to bear upon
her task.</p>

<p>The success of the play was never in doubt. To begin
with it was one of the Queen’s “good days.” At this
time Elizabeth was past sixty. And a temper which was
not particularly mild even in the heydey of its youth had
grown severe. But even this old and sour woman could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>not remain insensible to the wit and poetry of this new
“interlude,” performed with the highest skill and grace in
charmingly appropriate surroundings.</p>

<p>The Queen made no pretensions to literary taste as did
King James, her successor. But she knew what she liked.
And her untutored but extremely shrewd faculty seldom
led her astray. There were those, and Heming and Burbage
had been among them, who had been inclined to deplore
the fact that the author had not prepared stronger
food for Gloriana’s palate. A play of delicacy and fantasy,
all lightness and grace, would surely miss the mark.
She who had held her sides at the broad humors of
<i>Juliet’s</i> nurse and of <i>Hostess Quickly</i> would hardly appreciate
the melancholy <i>Jacques</i>, <i>Touchstone</i> and above
all, the subtle charm of <i>Rosalind</i>.</p>

<p>But this was not the case. Those finely accomplished
actors, William Kemp and Richard Burbage, had very
wisely been intrusted with the two chief male characters.
To be sure, it was hardly Nature’s design that they should
interpret them, but players of their genius dignify and
embellish every rôle for which they are cast. The noble
voice, the manly bearing, the persuasive ease of style,
that choicest fruit of many a victory hardly won, tells
just as surely in a whimsical impersonation a little away
from the main lines of human development, as in the
delineation of some incomparably drawn world figure
such as <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Falstaff</i>, <i>Lear</i>.</p>

<p>Unaided, these great men would have carried through
a weaker play. And yet they did but serve as a kind of
heavy relief, a somber frame for the central figure.
<i>Rosalind</i> has stood for three centuries as the symbol of
womanhood in its youthful glory. That embodiment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>the divinity of girlhood still remains without a peer. And
none could have given it more powerful, more appealing
expression than Anne Feversham.</p>

<p>From the moment the slight figure came out of the
depths of the forest and spoke her first magic lines in a
voice as clear as a bell, a hush seemed to fall upon all.
The occupants of the pavilion, no less than the humbler
spectators who were privileged to sit upon the grass were
spellbound. The tall figure, trim and slender, yet exquisite
in outline, looked a little gaunt, a little fine-drawn
in its close-fitting boy’s dress. The eyes shone out of the
pale face with a luster that fascinated those the least sensitive
to beauty. And the voice thrilling with a nameless
music ravished ears which knew it not for a cadence
borne upon the long night of the soul.</p>

<p>In that great and gallant company, however, were those
who had eyes to see and ears to hear. And when all
was said, the Queen was foremost among them. Harsh,
crabbed, difficult, narrow, insensible to many things as she
was to the very end of that long life that was now so near
its close, she retained her force of judgment and her
power of seeing things in their true relation. <i>Rosalind</i>
spoke to her; spoke to her not in her capacity as the
sovereign of a great people, but of that even more
sacred, more universal thing, which every woman verging
upon seventy has once been herself. Of a sudden
the raddled old cheeks were wet.</p>

<p>Men, too, were spellbound. Cecil, Raleigh, Pembroke,
Southampton and many others almost equally famous
were gazing upon that scene. These were first-rate minds,
and in all ages, in all countries, the eternal verities address
them in the same way. Sir Fopling knew that the Queen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>was weeping, and was amazed that she should not have
more regard for the havoc of her cheeks; Cecil knew
why she was weeping and held her so much more a Queen.</p>

<p>Anne was strung to the breaking point. And not the
Queen, and not the Lord Treasurer, with all their power
of mind, knew that. Richard Burbage and William
Kemp for all that they evoked the magic phrases from
her lips, for all that they were thrilled by the touch of
her fingers and the luster of her eyes were also unaware
of it. One man alone knew the perilous truth. And he
was the individual in the doublet slashed with bars of
yellow who stood leaning against one of the noble oaks
of the Forest of Arden, in full view of the play but out
of the sight of the audience.</p>

<p>Shakespeare never once allowed his eyes to stray from
<i>Rosalind</i>. He watched her every movement, her every
gesture. He had an intensity of solicitude that a father
might have shown for a beloved but fragile daughter.
At the end of each scene he led her apart from the others
and made her sit in the inner shade of the thicket. Here
while she rested the playwright encouraged her with word
and deed. He was all kindness, all tenderness, all forethought
and concern.</p>

<p>Not far away was Gervase. Still in his disguise he
had been placed among the musicians. At Shakespeare’s
behest he was biding his hour. Before that day was out
he had made up his mind to reveal himself to the Queen.
But the hour was not yet. It had been agreed between
Shakespeare and himself that the time and the manner
of the confession should be left to the player. And
among the audience was the man Grisewood narrowly
watching all that passed. He too felt that the hour was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>near in which the truth should be declared. But in his
case he was determined that the dramatic revelation
should turn to his own personal advantage.</p>

<p>In the meantime all went well with the play. Moreover,
as it proceeded the Queen began to show the liveliest
interest in the personality of the new <i>Rosalind</i>.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my lord,” she said, turning to Pembroke, an
acknowledged authority in all matters relating to the
theater, “who is that sweet chit in the doublet and trunk
hose who cannot counterfeit manhood for all her strivings?”</p>

<p>“By the bill of the play, your grace, she is called
<i>Rosalind</i> and is apparently of the sex of which she is so
poor an imitation.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, my lord!” said the Queen contemptuously,
“do you think I have neither ears nor eyes? This is a
<i>Rosalind</i> that will never be able to grow a beard. She
is of my own sex and a sweeter chit I never saw in all
my life.”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to gainsay your grace,” said Pembroke
with an elaborate air, “but according to the bill
of the play I have in my hand this <i>Rosalind</i> is impersonated
by a young Italian gentleman, one Signor Arrigo
Bandinello by name.”</p>

<p>“A young Italian fiddlestick!” said the Queen. “I tell
you that girl is as much an Italian gentleman as I am.
She shall attend us when the play is at an end. We will
go into this matter more fully.”</p>

<p>However, when the play was over, it was the author
who was first honored with a summons to the royal
pavilion. The Queen received him with high good humor.
For the time being she had forgotten the personality of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span><i>Rosalind</i> in the charm and glamour of the play itself. In
the graciousness of her mood she paid many compliments
to the author of “As You Like It” and was fain to admit
“that she liked it very well.”</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful man, Master Shakespeare,” said
the Queen. “And I think you must be the happiest man
alive.”</p>

<p>But there was nothing in the face of the player to suggest
that destiny. The somber eyes framed a question
which the august lady was quick to read and in the expansiveness
of her mood was even prepared to answer.</p>

<p>“You inhabit an enchanted world, Master Shakespeare.
All the persons in it are of your creation. You can order
their natures and their destinies exactly as it pleases you.”</p>

<p>“Alas, your grace!” The poet shook his head.</p>

<p>“Tell me, is it not so?” said the Queen.</p>

<p>“The world I inhabit, your grace, is that of human experience.
It is neither less nor more than that which we
all know. A maker of plays must depict life in its verity,
and that is a hard matter and one which tears the soul.”</p>

<p>The playwright spoke with the slow precision of one
whom has felt in his inmost fibers the long drawn agony
of mortal life. The Queen was a little amazed. In such
a bearing and in such a speech there was not a trace of
that enchanted mind, all airy lightness, all delicate fantasy,
which had wrought such ravishment. Nor was there
any sign of personal satisfaction in the triumph which had
been gained or in the fruits of success which now he was
beginning to gather in ample measure. The Queen, being
a woman, was a little inclined to be piqued by the
aloofness of the dramatist.</p>

<p>“Would you have us believe, Master Shakespeare,” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>said, “that the glad world which your inimitable fancy
creates for the pleasuring of your fellow-men is not a
source of joy and delight to its possessor? And would
you have us believe that the homage which all the world
has come to pay to you brings not pride nor happiness?”</p>

<p>The playwright who stood before his sovereign with a
throng of great persons gathered round him, answered
these rather embarrassing questions with a curiously unstudied
humility. Such a modesty of bearing made an
effect of perfect sincerity. Moreover, there was a complete
absence of self-regard. Few ordeals could have
been more trying for a man of small education, who knew
but little of courts, than to be exposed to the gaze of
many sharp and jealous eyes, and to be compelled to answer
on the spur of the occasion a series of most intimate
questions concerning himself and his art. Such an ordeal
would have been a tax upon the alert readiness of mind
and the self-possession of a highly trained courtier. But
there was not a trace of awkwardness in the bearing of
this singular man in the black doublet barred with yellow.
Indeed, there was nothing to suggest that the situation in
which he found himself was in any way unusual. And
there was no evidence that the presence of others, of even
the highest in the land, was a source of embarrassment
to him. No man could have been more completely at his
ease or more completely master of himself.</p>

<p>“I will answer the second of your questions first, your
grace,” he said, speaking very slowly and looking directly
at the Queen. “I am indeed a very proud man that the
travail of my mind should have given pleasure to those
whose favorable opinion must ever be coveted by all
honorable men. I unfeignedly rejoice and I am filled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>with gratitude that your grace and those about you are
pleased to approve my labors. And whatever of happiness
comes to me comes to me in that.”</p>

<p>“That is well spoken, Master Shakespeare,” said the
Queen. “You do well to allow that. And now touching
the first of these questions I would put to you. Is it that
you take no happiness from the possession and the exercise
of your most noble gifts?”</p>

<p>“None, your grace. They are but the mirror and the
counterfeit of life. We makers of plays live in a world
of shadows&mdash;a world of shadows woven out of our own
vitals as a spider weaves his web, and from which by
night or day there is no escape.”</p>

<p>“Would you escape them, Master Shakespeare, these
inimitable children of your fancy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your grace, I would on occasion; I would almost
yield life itself to do so.”</p>

<p>The Queen was astonished by the almost passionate
nature of the answer. This man was no shallow
deviser of masques to speed a summer’s day, but one to
whom existence was an almost intolerable burden, which
admitted of very little alleviation. And he was one who
read its riddles with the eyes of a seer.</p>

<p>“I begin to take your meaning, Master Shakespeare,”
said the Queen. “I had supposed that when these children
of your fancy laughed and made merry, you also rejoiced.
But I had forgotten that even in these plays of
yours the sadness outweighs the mirth as is the case with
life itself, whereby a double burden is laid upon the endurance
of their creator.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your grace, that is indeed true. And yet that is
not the full measure of a poet’s unhappiness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“In what does a poet’s unhappiness consist, Master
Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“It consists, your grace, in this. A poet sees too much,
feels too much, knows too much. He is stretched perpetually
on the rack of his excess. He reads more into
life than life itself will hold. Of a most private grief he
will make a little song. He will amuse the groundlings
with the tale of some deep injury he has suffered in his
bones. When he moves the crowd to tears, his fees are
paid in blood.”</p>

<p>There was something in the nature of the answer which
held the Queen. Good sense was her highest quality, and
it was that quality in others which never failed to speak
to her. She was captivated by the bearing of this man,
in whom she recognized not only the master of his craft,
but also what pleased her even more, a mature mind
which had much to say to her own acute and worldly
wise one.</p>

<p>Indeed, so gratified was the Queen with the demeanor
and the mental quality of Mr. William Shakespeare, that,
as a signal mark of her favor, he was commanded to sit
in her presence. The sovereign was prone to carry her
Tudor sense of importance to ridiculous lengths, but there
was some subtle instinct lurking within her which sought
equality between “the fair vestal throned by the west” and
the monarch of an empire infinitely wider than her own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was such a spectacle as could rarely have been
seen in that place, this homely fellow without airs or
graces or pretensions to fashion, seated in the presence
of his sovereign and treated by her with a respect
she extended to few. But not by word, deed or gesture
did he claim the estate of an equal. He was William
Shakespeare, the play-actor, and she was Elizabeth Tudor,
the conqueror of Spain.</p>

<p>But the kingdom of the mind is no Venetian oligarchy.
Those who speak the same language are all made free of
it. And queen and mime, alone perhaps among that assembly,
were able to address each other in the universal
tongue. Seldom, of late years at least, had this crabbed,
difficult and arrogant woman, been seen in a mood so
accessible. She spoke freely to this man of things of
which few had heard her speak. And presently she said:</p>

<p>“I hope, Master Shakespeare, you will devise a new
play for our diversion.”</p>

<p>“Already, your grace,” said the dramatist, “there is a
new play taking shape in my head. And if on a day it
should have the great good fortune to please the fancy of
your grace, the least of your servants will be the happiest
man in your realm.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>
<p>The words themselves may not have been without irony,
but the gentle voice showed no trace of that quality which
the countrymen of Shakespeare so much distrust.</p>

<p>“That is indeed high news, Master Shakespeare. And
of your bounty do we pray you that your new diversion
be all in the mood of comedy as is this inimitable piece
we have seen this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Alas, your grace!” The playwright shook his head.
“We poor makers of plays are no more than mortal men.
And as mortal men are subject to the coils of fate, so are
the characters we weave subject to those laws which govern
our being.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said the Queen.</p>

<p>“We makers of plays, your grace, often have but a
small part in our own contrivances. Many a time have I
devised a play in the spirit of comedy, but it is ever the
characters themselves who spin the plot. And whether
they shall spin it to a comic or a tragic issue none but
themselves shall say.”</p>

<p>“But you are the moulder and the master of your characters,
are you not, Master Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>“Alas, your grace, my characters are the moulders and
the masters of me!”</p>

<p>The Queen was perplexed by so paradoxical a saying.</p>

<p>“I confess,” said she, “I should ever have thought it to
be otherwise. Now is it that you would have us believe
that although you have yourself devised the characters
and the plot of your new interlude, you have so little hold
upon them that you know not until your play is written
whether it will be in the tragic or the comic vein?”</p>

<p>“It may not always be so, your grace, to the extent that
it is in this particular case. But in this instance, I will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>confess that I have but little hold upon the destiny of the
characters in the story.”</p>

<p>“That seems very odd, Master Shakespeare. And our
counsel to you is to take a very speedy and secure hold
upon your characters unless you would court our grave
displeasure.”</p>

<p>“Alas, your grace!” The playwright sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“Tell me, sirrah, what is your perplexity?”</p>

<p>“To tell my perplexity, your grace, would involve the
whole plot of the story, and a recital of that your grace
would doubtless find tedious.”</p>

<p>The Queen, however, in the expansiveness of her mood,
assured the author that he need have no fears upon that
account. On the contrary, she professed herself delighted
at the prospect of hearing it. She avowed, besides, that
her ladies would be immensely diverted by hearing the
argument of the new play fresh from the mint of the
poet’s invention.</p>

<p>“Do you tell us the story, I beseech you, Master Shakespeare!”
said the Queen. “And although I cannot pretend
that an unlearned woman such as myself has it in her
power to resolve your perplexity, there are about us those
of quick parts who shall hear it, who, I doubt not, will be
able to give you valuable advice upon the conduct of your
play.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the Queen spoke in mockery, since at heart
she was a despiser of most men and of all women. Mr.
William Shakespeare, however, was fully prepared to
take her at her word.</p>

<p>The poet, in order to give full effect to his narrative,
rose from the chair upon which he was seated. With perfect
self-possession and an air of supreme mastery which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>it is given to few men to attain, he stood to confront the
Queen and the expectant and critical throng of her
courtiers.</p>

<p>The lives of Gervase Heriot and of Anne Feversham
were at stake. And instinctively the poet knew that his
own life was at stake also. No hazard could have been
more perilous than that upon which he now proposed to
embark. He was about to take a very grave liberty with
an august personage who was notoriously quick to resent
even a minor one.</p>

<p>The mind of such a man, however, moves on a plane
where the mere personal equation is of very little account.
Had the least thought of self entered it, such a hazard
had not been for a moment possible. His own safety and
freedom were as nothing. The whole force of his mind
was centered in the hope of preserving the lives of these
hapless children of destiny.</p>

<p>“I will give the plot of the play as briefly as I can, your
grace. And under your grace’s favor and that of the
ladies and gentlemen of your court I will beg you to
devise a fitting and proper conclusion for it and thereby
spare the poor author many a sleepless night.”</p>

<p>The playwright spoke in a clear and measured tone.
His voice was raised so that all might hear every word
distinctly. The air of the man, which was far too much
infused with the play of a noble mind to bear any suggestion
of effrontery, had already made a profound impression
upon all. Such a voice, such a demeanor made
it clear to the Queen, no less than to the youngest page
within earshot, that the recital of this story involved issues
far deeper, far more complex than the mere idle gratification
of an author’s vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“An extraordinary man,” whispered the Lord Treasurer
in the ear of his friend, Pembroke. “I have heard
much of his plays of late, but I cannot pretend to be a
judge of ’em. But if they are as remarkable as the writer,
it is no wonder they stand so high in the public esteem.”</p>

<p>Pembroke made no reply. For one thing he was sadly
uneasy. He had grave fears as to the course the story
would take, for he had reason to suppose that Shakespeare
had actively concerned himself in the affairs of Gervase
Heriot, and that by hook or by crook he was determined
to bring them to the notice of the Queen. In Pembroke’s
view it would be the height of folly to introduce such a
perilous topic in such circumstances, but poets were a
peculiar race, apt to be carried away by an idea. And
the subtle significance of the man’s manner in the telling
of the story led my lord to anticipate the worst.</p>

<p>An expectant silence fell on this assembly. The playwright
had begun his narrative, and except for the inflections
of the clear, yet low and gentle voice, there
was not a sound to be heard within the precincts of the
pavilion.</p>

<p>“A certain young man,” the playwright began, “well
born, well favored, well endowed, with every grace of
mind and heart, fair of form as a young god, a very
Antinous among his kind, a beautiful youth who has
thought ill of none, much less having performed it
against any, has yet been born to one signal disadvantage.
And the disadvantage is so uncommon in itself
that it seems strange that he should suffer it. It is merely
that he is too much the favorite of fortune. And
yet I would have your grace remark, for that is the
essence of my story, how this one faint cloud in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>fair heaven of this youth’s tranquility is enough to contrive
his overthrow, to dim all his glories, to rob him
of all hope of peace and happiness in this life.”</p>

<p>The Queen nodded her head sympathetically. She
was following every word with the closest attention.
And indeed the pregnant manner of the story’s telling
compelled it.</p>

<p>“The young man’s disadvantage is very great inasmuch
that he has the ill-hap to inspire the covetous
envy of a wicked kinsman. It is a simple stroke of
ill-fortune, as your grace will see, which he cannot help
and for which he is not in any wise responsible. This
kinsman, his father’s brother, although himself a man of
property and well placed in the world, is yet consumed
with a desire to add to his own demesne his nephew’s
broad lands in the west country. He is a bitter-hearted
and envious man, who has carried on a perpetual war with
fortune because she has not made him the elder brother.</p>

<p>“Chance puts a weapon in the hands of this covetous
man. The age is one of peril and unrest. It is a
time in which every man suspects his neighbor. Nothing
is easier for a base man who is also bold than to
bring a charge of misfeasance against one he would remove
and whose lands he would inherit. And this is
what the uncle decides to do in the matter of his nephew.
He procures two evil men to accuse the young man
of having borne a part in a wicked and vile conspiracy
against the person of the sovereign. In the age in which
the play is cast such things are unhappily too common,
and this is a bad man’s opportunity.</p>

<p>“To be brief, your grace, the plot is laid, the charge
is made, the young man is brought to trial and condemned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
upon the evidence of two suborners. He is
unable to refute the accusation, so cunning are the
rogues by whom he is beset; moreover the author of the
plot has always passed for a just and disinterested man.</p>

<p>“To add to this unfortunate young man’s mischances,
his trial is held behind closed doors, for, as I say, the
times are greatly perilous and the public mind is much
inflamed. And he is condemned privily to the block,
and is sent to a strong fortress in the country, there to
die by the ax on a certain day. He makes an appeal to
his sovereign, an august and gracious lady whom he has
faithfully served. But stealthy serpent tongues have done
their work only too well. The Queen will not heed the
appeals of this innocent, unhappy youth, and he is left to
his cruel fate.</p>

<p>“The decree of heaven is otherwise, however. The inscrutable
Providence which has used the young man tenderly
in all things save one and in that one so unkindly,
begins to relent toward him, and, as your grace shall
hear, he is not left to die.”</p>

<p>The playwright paused for a moment. The attention
of his hearers was riveted by the force and cogency of a
narrative which was given with a solemnity so impressive
that it was made to appear a veritable page from
life itself. The Queen, her ladies and her gentlemen,
were spellbound by the vivid power of the recital. But
Cecil and other high officers of the household, who were
able to trace the parallel of the story were transfixed by
the man’s audacity.</p>

<p>Only too clearly did they recognize the source of the
plot of the dreadful drama this man was daring to unfold.
And if they could have done so they would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>stopped this hopelessly indiscreet recital of it. Blank
consternation was written in the faces of those who
knew whence the story came.</p>

<p>“Stop the mouth of that madman, for God’s sake!”
cried the Lord Treasurer in the ear of Pembroke.</p>

<p>But not Cecil and not Pembroke and not mortal man
in that assembly could stop the mouth of the player
now.</p>

<p>“Your grace,” the low, clear voice went on, “this
innocent youth is not left to die. The governor of the
fortress wherein the young man is held captive, a most
honorable and worthy and highly esteemed servant of
the state, has a young daughter. She too, like this ill-starred
youth, is passing fair, and like him is also happy
in every relation and attribute of life save one. And
her unhappiness is that she has not yet known love.</p>

<p>“But on a day, your grace, love comes to her. One
summer’s morning it is the will of fate that she shall
see the condemned man in the courtyard of his prison.
And from his own lips she learns his grievous history.
She learns that three days hence he is to die by the ax.</p>

<p>“A rage of pity comes upon her. At all costs she
is resolved to save him from a fate he has done nothing
to deserve. And this young girl, so brave and so high
of soul, finds a means to let him out of his dungeon,
and contrives his escape from the castle by a famous
secret passage way.</p>

<p>“And there is more to tell. Love has come to her.
She yields all that she has of security and also the many
benefits she enjoys under her father’s roof in order that
she may share the life of this hunted fugitive. Footsore
and hungry, by mere and mead, sleeping now under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>the open sky, now in barn or byre, they make their way
from place to place. The officers of the law are ever
upon their heels, but Providence is with them, so that
at last they come to a fair and famous city and fall in
with a cry of players.</p>

<p>“Now may it please your grace, one of these players
is not only an actor but is also a maker of plays. And
this man, by the bounty of the gracious lady his sovereign,
has been commanded to devise for her a pastoral
to be performed in her presence on the greensward of
a summer’s afternoon. And this man is so charmed
by the grace and beauty of these vagabonds, both of
whom are dressed as boys, so charmed by their fair
appearance and their goodly manners, that he would fain
admit them into the company of players, in order that
they may be trained as actors, and perchance on a day
delight the Queen with their accomplishment.</p>

<p>“At first these wanderers reject the proposal. But
they are hard set. They have journeyed far and food
and lodging are to seek. And being driven to a final
desperate extremity at last, they put their faith in this
play-actor. They reveal to him the whole of their tragic
history and crave his help.”</p>

<p>“One moment, Master Shakespeare.” It was the
harsh, imperious voice of the Queen. And it seemed to
fall like a thunderclap upon the expectant hush engendered
by the player’s narrative. “Do I understand you
to say that these persons informed this play-actor of
the whole matter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your grace, of the whole of their history,” the
player spoke with a calm fearlessness: “the whole of
it as it was at that time known to them. Moreover, this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>player, having heard their tragical story, resolved to help
them to the utmost of his capacity. To this end he had
them put in a disguise of an Italian music master and
his son.”</p>

<p>“In order, sirrah, I presume,” said the Queen’s harsh
voice, “to defeat the ends of justice?”</p>

<p>“Not in order to defeat the ends of justice, your grace,”
said the player with a calm deference which, however,
did little to allay the rising anger of the Queen, “but
rather to the end that justice might be vindicated. That
only was the purpose in the player’s mind as shall presently
appear. But under your grace’s favor, I will continue
this tragical history.”</p>

<p>“Do so, sirrah, I pray you.” The voice of the Queen
was now ominous indeed.</p>

<p>“The fugitives had lain but one night at the inn in
the city in the disguise of an Italian music master and
his son, when an unhappy distraught man came seeking
them. He was the devoted servant of the governor of
the castle. His master, it appeared, upon learning his
daughter’s act, had repaired straightway to his royal
mistress with news of the escape of his prisoner. Moreover,
he took upon his own shoulders the whole of the
blame. He withheld from the Queen the part his daughter
had played in his prisoner’s escape and submitted
himself to fate.”</p>

<p>By now there were many who would have stopped
the mouth of the player, and foremost among them was
the Lord Treasurer. This man, Shakespeare, knew too
much. And while some marveled at the madness of his
audacity, and all deplored his grievous indiscretion,
there was not one among them who might venture an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>attempt to silence him without affronting the temper
of the Queen.</p>

<p>But for that matter it had been impossible to silence
the player now. For one thing the Queen, with a face
that boded ill, was marking intently every word that fell
from the man’s lips. And again the player’s feelings
were wrought to such a pitch of interest by the stress
of his narrative that he seemed to be carried completely
beyond himself. For the consequences likely to ensue
he had no care. He was as one transfigured. Let
justice, mercy and truth prevail even if his own life
was the price to be paid for those brightest jewels in
Gloriana’s crown.</p>

<p>“Is there no means of stopping the mouth of that
madman?” growled the Lord Treasurer in the ear of
Pembroke.</p>

<p>But Pembroke could give no answer. He turned aside,
his breast tightening, his shoulders shaking convulsively.</p>

<p>“Pray proceed with your story, Master Shakespeare,”
said the harsh voice of the Queen.</p>

<p>“The servant of the governor of the castle,” continued
the player in obedience to this command, “an honest,
good fellow, no sooner learned his master’s peril, than
he pursued the fugitives from place to place over all
the midland country-side. Thus it was that in the end
he had the good fortune to come up with them at the
inn at Oxford. Now I would respectfully crave that
your grace remark with particular closeness that which
I am about to relate.”</p>

<p>“You can count upon our so doing, Master Shakespeare,”
said the Queen grimly.</p>

<p>The player smiled rather wanly. He could not remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
insensible to the ominous words and the yet more
ominous tone. But there was not a tremor of fear in
the dauntless face.</p>

<p>“It is simply, your grace, that this humble player, the
least of the Queen’s servants, is alone to blame for all
of that which follows. In the first place, the young
man was no sooner informed of the peril of the governor
of the castle than he desired to yield himself
straightway to the will of the sovereign. But the player,
mistakenly perhaps, was able to hold him from this
most honorable course until a riper season. And in the
meantime, the player set his mind to work in order
to adduce a tangible proof of this young man’s innocence,
so that when the time came for him to cast himself
upon the mercy of the Queen, he should not appear
empty-handed before her.</p>

<p>“Providence favored him. By means of a device which
I will not describe, lest I tax the patience of your grace,
the player was able to obtain an irrefragable proof of
the young man’s innocence. By the same means, moreover,
he was able to adduce clear evidence of those who
were guilty. But of this I will presently speak more
fully.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, however, while all this was going
forward, the hour was drawing near for the new interlude
to be given in the presence of the sovereign.
And the player deemed such a season to be not the least
favorable for two noble but ill-starred children of destiny
to invoke justice and mercy of a woman, the first
in the realm.”</p>

<p>At this point the player paused in his narrative. A
profound silence descended upon all. Every person who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>had heard the singular story was now aware that it
was no mere figment of a poet’s mind. It was a grim
and terrible reality. And that unhappy fact was declared
in the harsh and cruel eyes of the Queen.</p>

<p>For a full minute not a word was spoken. The player
had given as much of his story as was vital to his design.
And now with a true political instinct he refrained
from adding another word, but left it to the Queen
herself to speak.</p>

<p>She made no haste to do so. Astonished beyond measure,
resentful, angry, she brought the whole of her powerful
mind to bear upon the matter before giving expression
to her thoughts. Dumbfounded as she was by
the audacity and the indiscretion of this man, two facts
dominated her now. The mystery attending the circumstances
of the young man, Gervase Heriot’s escape
from Nottingham Castle, was now made clear. The unlucky
Sir John Feversham had neither art nor part in it
after all. He had kept a stubborn silence for no other
reason than to shield his daughter. And it was none
other than that froward young woman who had given
that charming performance in the new comedy but a few
minutes ago. At last the Queen turned to her ladies
with a look of sour triumph.</p>

<p>“Did I not say,” she cried, “that that was indeed no
youth who strutted in doublet and trunk hose?”</p>

<p>A moment afterwards the august lady had turned
imperiously to the player.</p>

<p>“This seems but a tame conclusion to your new interlude,
Master Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“Most humbly and respectfully do I beg your grace
to devise an issue to this pitiful story.” The player
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>had now sunk upon one knee. “It lies far beyond the
compass of my own poor contrivance. But it is within
the province of your grace to fashion it in either the
comic or the tragic vein. Yet if it shall seem good to
you to fashion it in the latter, there is one last boon
that I have to crave for these children of fate, and on my
knees I do so.”</p>

<p>“And what, pray, is the boon you crave, sirrah?”
There was not a spark of pity in the face or in the tone
of the Queen.</p>

<p>“The boon I would crave for them is this, your
grace. Should it not seem good to your grace to exercise
the most royal prerogative of mercy, they implore
you to allow them to die together on the same block, by
the same ax, in the same hour.”</p>

<p>This grim request sent a shudder through that horrified
assembly. But not a muscle relaxed in the ruthless
face of the Queen.</p>

<p>“Master Shakespeare,” she said in a slow, measured
voice, “your request shall be granted. These traitors,
young as they are, shall die together on the same block,
by the same ax, and in the same hour. And as there is
a God in Heaven, Master Shakespeare, you yourself
shall share the fate they have so richly merited.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was an important evening at the Mermaid Tavern.
Long before supper time the spacious upper chamber
with the sanded floor began to fill. All the
regular frequenters of the place were eager for news of
Will’s new comedy. But it was a long way in those
days from the palace at Richmond to the famous hostelry
in Eastcheap. Authentic information was tardy in
coming that evening.</p>

<p>The hour of eight was told on the clocks of the city.
Yet there was never a word of news of Will or of
his comedy. This was indeed strange. Among those
who came very often to the tavern for the sake of the
company to be found there was a number of men about
the Court. Not one of these has as yet appeared upon
the scene. And neither Will himself nor any of his
fellow-players had arrived.</p>

<p>Dishes of deviled bones and flagons of wine were laid
on the long table. The company sat down to a very
informal repast. Tongues were unloosed and rumor was
presently rife.</p>

<p>The assembly that had gathered in this long upper
chamber was a curious one. In the shabby and careless
garb of the poet, or in the soiled doublet of the writer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>for the theater was contained some of the choicest
spirits of the age. On most evenings this strange company
was garnished with a sprinkling of men of fashion
with some pretensions to wit, but these were absent to-night.
This fact, taken in conjunction with a singular
dearth of news was held to be a sinister omen. No
news is not always good news in matters relating to
the theater.</p>

<p>There was genuine concern among those present. Will
was a universally popular man. In spite of a very
remarkable success which had sprung from beginnings
of the humblest kind he bore himself invariably with a
modesty and a courteous consideration for others that
completely disarmed even those who had the most cause
to envy him. Moreover, those who had the entrée to
that sacred upper chamber at the Mermaid well knew how
thoroughly his success was deserved. For these were
first-rate minds. These men, as far as it was possible
for the contemporaries of William Shakespeare to do so,
realized and appreciated his accomplishment.</p>

<p>If Will had at last met with a check to his career
none would regret the fact more than these friendly
and admiring rivals who had an intense admiration for
his extraordinary genius. And some of them, moreover,
had already come to live in a kind of reflected glory that
it cast upon them.</p>

<p>Rumors of failure grew with the arrival of each newcomer
who yet had no first-hand news to give.</p>

<p>“Did he let you con the piece, Martin?” asked a
gray and worn veteran with a ragged beard of an individual
very familiar to himself who sat at the head of
the long table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, he did so. And I tell you it is the best thing
he has done yet. If he makes a failure of that, God
help the age, say I.”</p>

<p>“He was not very happy about it two nights ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s Will’s way. He never does anything but
that he wishes it better.”</p>

<p>“And yet they say he never blots a line, eh?” said a
young man with flaming hair who sat opposite.</p>

<p>“It is only Ben who says that,” rejoined the veteran
at the table-head. “And Ben blots so many himself
that he thinks nobody else takes any pains by comparison.”</p>

<p>“Then you consider this new piece a good thing?”</p>

<p>“Aye, good enough, good enough. It is a better thing
than any of us will ever see our names to.” The speaker
sighed. He was a man of infinite courage and ambition.
But he had lived long enough and had striven hard
enough to learn the sharp truth that these things of
themselves will not conquer. “But by God!” The fine
poet and great-hearted man took up his flagon. “I’d
be the last in the world to begrudge Will his good luck.
His fortune is our fortune too. He is a nonesuch and
not again will the world look on his like. He is a king
in his own right, and by God, I drink to him. Here’s
to our monarch. May God protect him, and may he
never write a worse comedy than ‘As You Like It.’”</p>

<p>Dekker rose and held his flagon aloft. And all the
others at the long table followed his example.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of voices and a clink of cups.</p>

<p>These men could not bring themselves to admit that
by any possibility the true prince had met defeat at last.
Still, the total absence of news from Richmond was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>ominous. But even if the Queen had not approved the
new comedy, that was not warrant sufficient to assume,
as more than one among that company made bold to
maintain, that the new comedy was not worthy of her
approval.</p>

<p>“’Tis a fine thing,” said the man at the head of the
table, “and you may lay to that. His genius ripens
every day. There is nothing in my opinion beyond the
compass of Will’s invention.”</p>

<p>“He lacks but one thing,” said a large, ugly and pock-marked
fellow who came slowly into the room.</p>

<p>“And what is that, Ben?” was the question that was
promptly fired at the newcomer.</p>

<p>“A little learning, my friends, to temper the heat of
his mind. A little of the classic severity of Athens to
mellow the over-sharpness of his wit, to trim and clip
the excess of his redundancy, to confine the natural incontinence
of his humors.”</p>

<p>But the words of Ben were drowned in good-natured
laughter. All knew the foibles of this heavy and slow-moving
man. He was a surly dog fond of his growl.
He must ever run contrary to received opinion. He had
an exaggerated regard for the classic tongues. But
there was no stouter fellow, no stauncher friend, and
there was not a grain of smallness in his nature.</p>

<p>“Sit down, you dog,” said the time-worn warrior at
the table-head, “and bury your mask in a flagon. Hi,
drawer, a cup of Muscadel for Master Jonson. Ben,
my son, with all your learning, aye, and with all your
genius, too, you will never be quite man enough to don
the mantle of William the Peerless.”</p>

<p>“Did I ever say I would?” said Ben roughly. “Is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>there any man alive that ever heard me speak so windily?
There is no man living or dead who is the peer of our
incomparable William and I care not who hears me
say it.”</p>

<p>The great rude fellow brought down his bricklayer’s
fist with such a resounding thud upon the table that the
dishes rattled and the wine slopped over in a dozen cups.
But this rough diamond, who as yet did but stand at
the threshold of renown, was freely forgiven all the inconvenience
he caused for the sake of that honest enthusiasm
whereby he did himself honor in the eyes of all.</p>

<p>The motley crew who sat night after night at that
table were without exception men of parts and understanding.
Whether their ruffles were ink-stained,
whether their hands were lily-white, whether they wore
silk and fine linen or plain bombazine, whether they
lived by the sword or by the pen, or whether they had
no need to live by either, there was no appeal from their
judgments upon poetry and the drama, and posterity
has not found occasion to reverse their verdicts. It
was the great age indeed. These were men of rare mental
power, of large and liberal intercourse. They knew
the highest when they met it and knew how to pay it
homage.</p>

<p>For example, this rude fellow Ben Jonson, this clumsy,
loud-voiced, opinionative Scotsman, a pock-marked, ugly
creature who had lived rough and who had the brand
of a felon on his thumb was the coming man. He would
go far, said the quidnuncs. He was heavy metal of the
royal currency; one who under Providence was destined
to be second only to Will himself.</p>

<p>Thus men cast in a gentler mold made room for him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>He was no favorite, to be sure. His manners were too
rude, his opinions too unqualified. But the sacred fire
was in his veins. And those who were wont to dispute
precedence with persons of far more account in the
eyes of the world were proud to sit at the feet of Ben.</p>

<p>The long July evening was closing in. The candles
had been brought and the shutters drawn in the long
upper chamber. And that which hitherto had been
hardly more than a thrill of half-expectant surmise was
now become a slow agony of suspense. It was incredible
that news had not come from Richmond. The play
must have been over by six o’clock. The verdict of
Gloriana and her court must have been delivered long
ago.</p>

<p>Was it possible that the miracle of the age had tasted
his first defeat? Well, and if he had? said the graybeard
at the end of the table. Gloriana and her Court
were not infallible. Will should read his comedy to
his peers that night, as he had done on many occasions
previously. Theirs should be the verdict, for they
alone, with all respect to Gloriana, were qualified to
give it.</p>

<p>The brave words from the table-head were received
with loud approval from a score of stalwarts who by
now had gathered round the board. Such words were
well and wisely spoken. But suddenly there fell a hush.
A famous and admired figure came quietly, almost stealthily,
into the room.</p>

<p>It was that of a bearded, brown-faced man of forty,
trim and soldierly of look, secure and curiously authoritative
of bearing. His dress was rich and fine; his air
that of a courtier, urbane, polished, calm, quizzical.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>There was the coxcomb in the outward man, but not a
trace of it in the far-looking, eagle-glancing eyes. This
was a great figure, even in that company, which measured
a man not by his outward assemblance but by his deeds.</p>

<p>“Ah, now we shall know,” cried the man at the table-head.
“Here is Wat. Newly from Richmond, else I’ll
never drink sack again out of a bombard until I attain
the age of a hundred and twenty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Martin, newly from Richmond, as you say,”
came the courtier’s lisp. “Newly from Richmond, newly
from Richmond.”</p>

<p>The newcomer sank down in a manner of extreme
weariness in a vacant chair. He sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“A cup of the muscadel for Sir Walter,” said the man
at the table-head. “And lively about it, boy. No need
to tell us what has happened, Wat. But we did not
think it was so bad as all this. We did not think it
possible that Will could fail. Is it&mdash;tell me, Wat&mdash;that
Gloriana has smelt some affront in the new piece? Well,
well, she is getting old, and even in her prime she was&mdash;well,
shall we say?&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;why, body
o’ God, what’s the matter with the fellow?”</p>

<p>The speaker had good reason to ask the question.
Raleigh&mdash;the brown-faced courtier was no less than he&mdash;seemed
utterly overcome. Something untoward had
most certainly happened. There was more than a mere
matter of a play’s failure or success in the dismay of
that strong face which shone a bleak gray in the uncertain
light of the room.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter? Tell us, for the love of
God!”</p>

<p>But Raleigh shook his head haplessly. He who knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>not the meaning of fear in the presence of bodily peril,
he whose resolution never failed in great crises, was
wholly unable to tell the news he bore.</p>

<p>“Is it Will?” A sense of foreboding had descended
suddenly upon all. “Tell us, I pray you.”&mdash;The eagerly
anxious voices sank in the oddest manner. “Has aught
happened to Will Shakespeare?”</p>

<p>Raleigh did not answer. But that face so eloquent
of power and high capacity seemed to grow a little
bleaker. And then twenty pairs of eyes that were turned
almost fiercely upon it saw that a rush of sudden tears
was shining there.</p>

<p>The man at the head of the table laid a hand to his
heart.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>His exclamation went echoing through the silence of
the long room. Again the solemn hush descended. That
which Walter Raleigh had not courage to tell, not one of
these men could muster the courage to ask.</p>

<p>What could have happened? Those were perilous
times indeed; times in which the quietest, most law-abiding
citizen took his life in his hand when he walked
down the street. The tragedy of poor Kit Marlowe was
in every mind. Had Will Shakespeare, the incomparable
poet and charming personality, met the assassin’s knife
by chance or by design? The face of Raleigh portended
not less than that. Yet not one of these men could summon
enough resolution to set his doubts at rest. The
silence was painful. A pin could have been heard to fall
in the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came sounds of heavy feet stumbling,
blundering up the wooden stairs. The door was flung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>open. A thick, squat, gnarled-looking fellow reeled in
like a man under the influence of wine. His face shone
livid in the light of the candles.</p>

<p>It was Burbage the tragedian.</p>

<p>“Speak, man! Tell the news!” came the hoarse demand
of a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare,” The voice of the tragedian could
hardly be heard. “He is arrested by the Queen’s order.
They say&mdash;they say he will lose his head.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>RIEF, consternation, horror surged through that
room. For the moment, the shock of the announcement
was more than they could bear. It
was as if each man present had been stunned by a blow.
But the calm was for the moment only. In the next came
a babel of tongues framing a score of incoherent questions.</p>

<p>Richard Burbage replied to none of these. He stood
an instant swaying, his ashen face framed in the eerie
glow of the candles. And then without a further word
he turned and passed like a ghost through the door of
the room with the same abruptness with which he had
entered it. He went headlong, stumbling and creaking,
down the ricketty stairs of the old tavern and out into
the July evening.</p>

<p>In the street, hard by the signboard, under the shadow
of the tavern wall, two men lay in wait for the tragedian.
One of these was his fellow-player, William
Kemp, the other John Heming the manager of the Globe
Theatre. These also were men of strong feelings, but
they had them under control, whereas Richard Burbage
who might almost be said to worship the ground on
which the poet trod, had been carried completely away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>by this direst of tragedies, which he knew not how to
face.</p>

<p>As became good men, true friends, staunch comrades,
Kemp and Heming were fully determined not to let Burbage
pass out of their sight during the remainder of that
night. But they must not show themselves in his. Already
he had resented their presence fiercely, had cursed
them when they had sought to console him, and had so
far fallen from that poise of mind and temper which
at ordinary times made him a most agreeable companion,
as to threaten to do them violence, “if they would not
have the goodness to keep themselves to themselves and
stand out of his light.”</p>

<p>Thus William Kemp and John Heming remained well
in the shadow of the tavern wall. But when their distracted
friend came out of the inn, perhaps a little
sooner than they had expected him to do so, they proceeded
to follow him at a respectful distance. Without
betraying their own presence, they contrived to keep him
well in view.</p>

<p>Certainly there was very good ground for such solicitude.
The tragedian swayed about from side to side like a
ship in a gale, now up one deserted street, now down
another. And all these dark purlieus of the city swarmed
with perils at that hour of the night. Moreover, the
ostensible condition of this pedestrian, the vagaries of
whose gait certainly resembled those of a man far gone
in liquor, seemed to cry aloud for the attentions of the
vigilant cutpurse or the lurking footpad.</p>

<p>With unseeing eyes, with unstable limbs, with mind
insensible of its surroundings, with steps not knowing
whither they were bent, the tragedian walked the byways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
of the city during the whole of that night. Like
the fate-riven figures in those soul-shaking tragedies in
whose delineation he excelled all men, he was at the
mercy of an anguish of mind that was tearing him in
pieces.</p>

<p>This was a large and noble nature. And bitterly it
was rent because it had not been more vigilant. Richard
Burbage felt himself unworthy of the sacred duty
imposed upon him by his fraternal intimacy with the poet.
He had an insight into human nature which enabled him
to understand a certain weakness that must inevitably
attend such transcendent powers as those of William
Shakespeare. And this understanding seemed to lay
the charge upon him of watching over this man who
was not as other men.</p>

<p>To this trust Burbage felt he had not been true.
Yet it was not easy to know by what means he could
have saved his friend from his terrible pass. Times
and again he had besought him to be prudent, and his
counsels had been urged with intense conviction. None
realized more clearly than Burbage that it was indeed
a perilous hour for any man to be concerned with treason.
The Queen’s temper was implacable. She who
had done to death a kinswoman and a queen because her
own personal safety was held to be remotely threatened
was not likely to know the meaning of pity in the case
of an humble play-actor who had mingled so openly in
the cause of a condemned traitor.</p>

<p>Burbage mourned the madness of his friend. Pacing
the dark streets of the city during the watches of the
night in a state of mind bordering upon frenzy, he
was a man self-tormented. Yet after all, he was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>no wise to blame. No grace of his, no vigilance, indeed,
no human foresight could have averted this tragic issue.</p>

<p>The two comrades of the tragedian kept the swaying
figure ever in view. Wherever it went that night they
followed it. Hour after hour Burbage wandered purposeless
about the city. His grief, silent and contained
though it was, was a thing dreadful to behold.</p>

<p>Towards midnight he came to the river. A new fear
then gripped the hearts of his comrades. Very stealthily
they crept up closer behind him. What more
likely than that one in such a frame of mind should
have recourse to those dark waters which have done
so much to ease the misery of the world? Bareheaded,
unsteady of gait, wild of mien, the tragedian walked
hour by hour upon the very brink of death. And all
that time his two friends watched and waited yet dared
not show themselves.</p>

<p>The night was oppressively hot. The summer air was
charged with pent-up forces, and while it was still dark
these sought opportunity to wreak themselves upon the
thirsting earth. The moon and stars were hid; all the
heavens were a dense mass of pitch; presently came
lightning and peal upon peal of thunder. It was the
prelude to a terrific storm and the man by the verge of
the river welcomed it with every fiber of his being.</p>

<p>The words of <i>Lear</i> were yet unborn. But in such a
night and tempest of the soul was to walk that figure
which this unhappy man was one day to teach the ages
to pity. His head was bare and unbent to the storm;
a hurricane lashed the upturned face; he was drenched
to the skin; and yet this rage of heaven was as nought
to the tumult in the mind of one poor tragedian.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>
<p>And like their friend, wholly undefended from this
wild fury of the elements, William Kemp and John
Heming stood cowering a little way off in the lee of a
wall. All the long night through, in spite of darkness
and tempest, they never left him. And when at last came
the dawn, and with it some abatement of the frenzy of
the heavens, they stood with him still by the bank of the
grim river.</p>

<p>Drenched to the skin, and utterly weary and wretched
as they were, they did not once allow Richard Burbage
to pass out of their sight. Wherever he went they must
go also; to all that he did they must be a party. Yet only
in the last resort must they venture to declare themselves
to him.</p>

<p>The slow hours passed. Richard Burbage still lingered
by that river which in one brief instant would
have eased him of his pain. But at last, just as the hour
of eight was told by the churches of the city, resolve appeared
to brace and quicken the exhausted frame. A
new purpose, a new strength enfolded that unhappy figure.
Burbage suddenly started to walk briskly along the
river bank in the direction of Richmond.</p>

<p>Hungry, exhausted, profoundly miserable, his two comrades
continued to follow him. All night had they been
waiting for some such manifestation of design, for
this was a man of powerful and resolute character. It
was now more imperative than ever that this vigilance
should not relax. They knew not what secret spring of
action had moved him. And in his present mood there
was nothing of which he was not capable.</p>

<p>On and on he walked, briskly now and with an appearance
of ever-increasing resolve. Through fair meadows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and riverside gardens and hamlets they passed. By
ten o’clock, they had left the river below them and were
ascending the steep and gloriously wooded slopes of
Richmond Hill.</p>

<p>Every fiber of the tragedian’s being seemed now in the
thrall of his new purpose. Not once did he tarry or
look back. All unaware that he was being so closely
followed, he turned at the top of the hill into Richmond
Park.</p>

<p>It was a morning such as makes of earth a paradise.
The air was cool, fragrant, delicious after the great
storm of the night. Long shafts of gold light pierced
the branches of the trees; the wet bracken shone with
crystals; the sky was one wide unbroken promise of a
gorgeous noon; the deer flitted in and out of the clean-washed
spaces, between low-hanging canopies of leaves.
Earth was rejoicing this morning of July in the solace
and refreshment that the night had brought to her. All
was well with her now. Her fainting energies had been
renewed. And all was now well with one among her
children, one poor and frail tragedian.</p>

<p>The squat, rather ungainly figure, striding wide as
though the boards of the playhouse were still its theater,
neither passed nor faltered in its course. Bared head
upflung, a curious rigidity in the face, there was high
purpose in every movement now.</p>

<p>Richard Burbage sought the broad path that led to
the Queen’s palace. And no sooner had he come to it,
than he greatly increased the pace at which he walked.
Indeed, as the row of imposing turrets of the royal demesne
came into view at a turn in the road, he almost
broke into a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>William Kemp and John Heming, so exhausted by
now that they could scarcely drag one foot after the
other, suddenly awoke with a kind of bewildered dismay
to the fact that the Queen’s palace was, beyond a
doubt, the goal of their quarry. Breathlessly, they followed
ever in his wake, but in the last hundred yards or
so, he had gained upon them considerably.</p>

<p>Before the gate of the palace, however, Richard Burbage
had to call a halt. Certain formalities had to be
observed before the halberdiers on guard could be induced
to pass a stranger through. And to their question
of who this stranger was and what was his pleasure, the
two comrades of the actor were able to come up to the
gate just in time to hear his reply.</p>

<p>“I am Richard Burbage, the tragedian, and I desire to
see the Queen without delay on a matter of the most
urgent importance.”</p>

<p>Moreover, these words were spoken in that magnificently
rotund and authoritative voice that never failed
to send a thrill through the Globe Theatre.</p>

<p>And even now in these strange circumstances, it did
not fail of its effect. The guards of the Queen were
no more than mortal men. And this man with great
eyes burning in an ashen face was more than mortal
now. He was in the thrall of a divine idea. It was not
for those on a lower plane of being to deny such an imperious
instancy. Without delay, Richard Burbage, the
tragedian, was permitted to pass through the gate.</p>

<p>William Kemp and John Heming stood at the threshold
of the Queen’s palace to watch the tragedian pass
from their view. But when they also were asked by
the sentinels at the gate who they were and what they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>sought, they did not venture to proclaim either their
business or themselves.</p>

<p>They drew off silently a little way into the bracken,
there to await the issue. Sick at heart, overcome with
despair, they flung their completely exhausted bodies
into the wet grass.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Queen was taking counsel already with the
Lord Treasurer, Cecil, her all-wise and all-powerful
minister. This morning, she was in a harsh
and vengeful mood. Many were the plots she had known
in the course of a troubled life against the security of
that person for whose well-being she had so great a reverence.
And each one, as it occurred, had the effect
of hardening that naturally ruthless temper to which,
like others of her race, she was never afraid to give free
play.</p>

<p>The young man, Gervase Heriot, had been proved
guilty upon that which was held to be good and sufficient
evidence, of a plot against her life. He had been
condemned to death by the Court of Star Chamber sitting
in camera. But by the wanton and wicked connivance
of the young daughter of Sir John Feversham, in
whose custody he was held in Nottingham Castle against
the time of his execution, Heriot had been able to break
out of his prison. Subsequently, the condemned man, in
the company of this wicked girl, had wandered about the
country many weeks, finally falling in with one Shakespeare,
an actor and writer for the theater, who, well
knowing they were proscribed, had actively befriended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>them. Moreover, with unforgivable effrontery, this play-actor
had chosen to make public confession of his guilt
at a singularly ill-chosen time.</p>

<p>The Queen was not in a mood to hear of leniency in
this heinous matter. But Cecil, the Lord Treasurer, was
a very wise man, deliberate in speech, tardy in judgment.
And the view he held was at direct variance with that
of his august mistress.</p>

<p>The Lord Treasurer had already brought the cool and
detached mind of a statesman to bear upon a most difficult
problem. The actors in this unhappy drama were
nothing to him in themselves. Heriot was a man of
family, with a considerable estate in the west of England;
the girl was the daughter of Sir John Feversham,
a man of good reputation, who had rendered thirty
years of honest service to the Queen. The man Shakespeare
was by profession an actor, and of him there was
nothing more to be said. Indeed, as far as the Lord
Treasurer was concerned, there was nothing more to
be said of any of the persons of the drama. As mere
private individuals, they had not the least interest for
him; the merits of their cause concerned him but little,
yet public expediency, that and only that, was a thing of
paramount importance in his eyes. And when all was
said, this was certainly a plaguy ill matter, and it had
given my lord a very anxious night.</p>

<p>It seemed that Pembroke, a man whom Cecil regarded
as a person of weight, had expressed a very definite
opinion in regard to the case. According to Pembroke,
the man Shakespeare was widely known and esteemed
not in London merely, but also throughout the length
and breadth of the kingdom. He had behaved with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>gravest unwisdom, but Pembroke held staunchly to the
view that his action was not of a character to incur
the inclemency of the law. Moreover, the play-actor
had the excuse that he sought an occasion to establish
the innocence of a deeply wronged man.</p>

<p>Yet here was a very sore point with the statesmanlike
soul of the Lord Treasurer. Heriot had been condemned
by the Court of Star Chamber, and Cecil had not the
least desire that the case should be re-heard. At the best,
the whole affair constituted one of those unsavory businesses
which it is ever the aim of true statecraft
to keep out of the light of day. To this point of
view, however, Pembroke had made the cogent rejoinder
that since the whole story had been given to the
world, it was no longer possible to treat it as a mystery.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was this fact which rendered Shakespeare’s
action unpardonable in the sight of the Queen.
She, too, had a faculty of statesmanship, and she was
well able to appreciate the point involved; but also she
had a woman’s power of illogical resentment, and in her
view not the least part of the player’s crime was the inconvenience
it caused.</p>

<p>Cecil, having duly taken all the circumstances into
account, was already strongly in favor of mercy. It
would be wise, in his view, to grant a pardon to the player.
The pressure of public opinion was likely to be great,
and in the opinion of Cecil that was a cardinal matter.
But the Queen was obdurate. She was incensed by the
audacity of the man. Great care had been used to keep
the whole of this ugly business a close secret, but all
precaution had been rendered nugatory by this man’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>amazing indiscretion in regard to things that did not
well bear the light of day.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the Queen, with an air of finality,
“what I have said, I have said. This man shall make
payment for his wicked folly.”</p>

<p>“Be it so, your grace,” said the minister, with a sad
shake of the head.</p>

<p>He knew how vain it was to persist when once the
Queen had made up her mind. She had all a Tudor’s
despotism. The statesman shrugged his shoulders disconsolately.
The man Shakespeare had certainly behaved
like a stark fool, and richly merited any fate that could
overtake him, for my Lord Treasurer’s was that practical
order of mind that hates a fool quite as much as it
hates a rogue. The one was intelligible, but the other
was an affront to the human race. Still, the man
Shakespeare had many highly placed friends. And if
Cecil himself had little use for the order of things the
man represented, he recognized, with that large grasp
of mind in which none of his age excelled him, that this
play-actor stood for human amenity. And that in itself
was a thing that even the most cynical of statesmen cannot
afford to neglect.</p>

<p>The Lord Treasurer was about to withdraw from the
Queen’s presence, when one of her gentlemen came into
the room.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “under your good pleasure, one
Richard Burbage, a tragedian, would speak with you upon
a matter of great urgency.”</p>

<p>“A pox take him,” said the Queen, roughly. “A pox
take all comedians and all tragedians, too. I would that
I had never set eyes on any of the tribe. Send the rogue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>about his business with a flea in his ear. Or stay&mdash;send
him to us and we will hear what he has to say. And God
help the rogue, if he speaks amiss.”</p>

<p>The gentleman withdrew. A minute afterwards, he
ushered into the room with great ceremony one Richard
Burbage, a tragedian.</p>

<p>It happens continually, in the process of nature, that a
man’s calling is declared in his personality. The soldier,
the clergyman, the lawyer and the horse-dealer are
cases in point. But no man could have borne clearer
evidence of the unhappy estate to which it had pleased
providence to call him than Richard Burbage, the tragedian.
His gaunt face was haggard, his bloodshot eyes
were wild, his somber dress was muddy and in sad disorder.</p>

<p>“Well, my man, what is your pleasure?” said the
Queen sourly enough, as soon as this odd figure appeared
before her.</p>

<p>The tragedian showed no undue haste to reply to the
question. There was a slow force in him for which the
Queen and Cecil were not prepared. And when he spoke,
it was with the calm precision of one secure of soul.</p>

<p>“Your grace,” said the tragedian, and for all his wild
eyes he looked steadily at the Queen, “it is my desire to
offer my life for the life of William Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>The mood of the Queen was by no means agreeable.
Nevertheless, these simple and considered words struck
home to the heart of the woman. They had no savor of
vainglory. They were the fruit of a rare spirit, and she
who was accustomed to judge men was quick, almost in
her own despite, to recognize the source from which they
sprang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me why you offer it, Master Burbage,” said the
Queen. “Tell me why life has so little savor for you,
that you would yield it for that of a rival actor?”</p>

<p>“I offer my life, your grace, for that of one so far beyond
myself that, although I enjoy my days as much as
any man alive, there can be no higher privilege than to
give them for such a one as he. And the day will surely
come when the whole world will rise up and call me
blessed.”</p>

<p>These were wild words for prosaic ears. There was
almost a core of madness in them, yet it was impossible
to doubt the grim sincerity of this fanatic.</p>

<p>The Queen looked at the Lord Treasurer, and the Lord
Treasurer looked at the Queen. One fact at once shone
clear in the minds of both. It was no ordinary man who
offered life itself on the altar of friendship.</p>

<p>“The truth is,” said the Queen at last, “you mad players,
who spend your days in mouthing bombast and in
tearing passions to tatters, get a kind of swelling in your
brains. The truth is, Master Burbage, you over-color all
the facts of life. Your speech in consequence is high-flown,
your behavior nonsensical, your appearance
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“It may be so, your grace.” The player spoke slowly
and calmly, and yet without any great show of humility.
“But I would entreat your grace not to overlook the fact
that Richard Burbage would pay away his life for the
boon he craves.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirrah, I appreciate that,” said the Queen. “And
to me, Master Burbage, I confess it makes you a subject
for confinement in a mad-house. How say you, my
lord?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>But my lord was thinking so deeply that he failed to
answer the question of his august mistress. It was the
business of his life to estimate men and things; and for
perhaps the first time in his career, he was face to face
with men and things with which his recondite knowledge
and his remarkable faculty seemed powerless to deal.</p>

<p>“Yes, you bombastical players have an inflammation of
the mind, there is no doubt about it,” said the Queen.
“In your opinion, Master Burbage, I do not doubt the
author of ‘As You Like It’ is the greatest man alive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your grace,” said the tragedian, very simply, “he
is undoubtedly that in his own province, and as, in my
humble judgment his province is the highest of all, I cannot
honestly claim less than that precedence for him.
But, of course, I speak, your grace, as but a strutter of
boards and a mouther of bombast. Yet in my humble
opinion, a man must be what he is, and be that only, and
with all his heart. Nature fashioned me for the theater.
Therefore, my life is consecrated to the theater, which
for me is the sum of all things, the highest good. And
therefore I say to your grace, that never again will the
theater look upon the like of William Shakespeare, who
to me, and to many another in this age and in ages yet to
come, must ever remain the brightest jewel in Gloriana’s
crown. And if it be given to Richard Burbage to purchase
with his own life the priceless things that lie as yet
unborn in the womb of our immortal poet’s invention, it
will be a great end for a poor tragedian.”</p>

<p>These singular words were spoken plainly and
bluntly enough, but with an air of deference. And they
were absolutely sincere. Whatever the Queen’s views
might be concerning the sanity of play-actors, she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>compelled to recognize this speech, perhaps more by its
manner than by its matter, as the product of a powerful
and well-ordered mind. It was now the turn of the
Queen to ponder deeply. In spite of herself, she could
not help being affected by the demeanor of this man.</p>

<p>Now it almost seemed as if Providence had set itself
to work on the poet’s behalf, and was determined to
make the most of a favorable turn. For that was the
moment chosen by it for the announcement to be made
to the Queen that two most distinguished persons, the
Earl of Pembroke and Sir Walter Raleigh to wit, most
humbly craved audience of her Grace.</p>

<p>“I will see them,” said the Queen, peremptorily. “Let
them be brought to me.” She then added sourly to the
Lord Treasurer, “They are upon this same plaguy business,
I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p>Presently appeared these two distinguished gentlemen,
true ornaments of their age. Each was a singularly
handsome man, not yet in middle life; each had the
marked ease of bearing of those who are very familiar
with their surroundings. The Queen received them with
the rough humor, caustic, witty and by no means unpleasant,
which she inherited from her father and kept for her
intimates.</p>

<p>“Well, my friends,” she said, “I’ll wager a tester I
know already what is your good pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Your grace were infinitely less in wisdom were the
case otherwise,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“You have come to plead the cause, I do not doubt, of a
very foolish and wicked man.”</p>

<p>The silence of Pembroke gave assent to the harsh
words.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>
<p>“Well, my lord, I hope you are prepared as is Master
Burbage here to yield your life for him.”</p>

<p>“If it were our privilege, your grace, to do that, we
should be greater men than we are like to be&mdash;with all
respect to Sir Walter here&mdash;in the eyes of posterity.”</p>

<p>“A pox upon posterity! Who cares a fig for it? The
hour in which we live alone matters to all of us. But tell
me, my lord, why do you choose to concern yourself with
the matter of this foolish play-actor? And also I would
have you make known your wishes in regard to him.”</p>

<p>“Touching your grace’s first question,” said Pembroke,
“I am honored by the friendship of one whom I esteem
beyond all other men, and for whose deliverance I will
gladly pay into the treasury as round a sum as I can well
afford.”</p>

<p>The Queen gave a grunt of disgust. The raddled face
wore a very unpleasant look.</p>

<p>“Humph,” said she. “That seems little enough, my
lord. Master Burbage here offers his life.”</p>

<p>Pembroke turned instantly to the tragedian, with his
most courtier-like bow.</p>

<p>“Master Burbage does himself infinite honor,” he said.
“I offer the half of my estate and he offers the whole of
his, therefore is he twice the man that I am in the sight
of heaven.”</p>

<p>“A well-turned speech, my lord,” said the Queen. She
then fixed her sour smile upon Raleigh. “Tell me, Sir
Walter,” she said, “what is the price you are prepared to
pay for this foolish and wicked player’s ransom?”</p>

<p>The point-blank question was answered readily enough.</p>

<p>“The half of my fortune, your grace,” said Raleigh,
“even as my Lord Pembroke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“But Master Burbage here,” said the Queen, acidly, “is
prepared to pay the whole of his life.”</p>

<p>“Your grace,” said Raleigh with shining eyes, “Master
Burbage is indeed a man happy in his valor and noble in
the scope and compass of his nature. Our poet is fortunate
in such a friend, yet such high constancy is not
less than his deserts.”</p>

<p>This frank speech gave pause to the Queen. When the
worst had been said of her, a robust commonsense remained
the keystone of her character. These were men
she was bound to respect. And to hear them express
such unqualified opinions in regard to this play-actor had
the effect in some degree of modifying her attitude.
Besides, she herself believed the playwright to be a very
remarkable man. But the combined testimony of such
men as Pembroke and Raleigh made it clear that he was
even more remarkable than she knew him to be.</p>

<p>“My Lord Burleigh,” she said abruptly, addressing
Cecil, “let this man Shakespeare be brought to us. We
will hear what defence he will venture of his froward
conduct.”</p>

<p>The Lord Treasurer quitted the room at once, in obedience
to this command. Burbage, Pembroke and Raleigh
would have followed him, had not the Queen ordered
them to remain where they were.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was a long five minutes of most uncomfortable
silence between the four curiously diverse
persons in the Queen’s morning chamber. Gloriana
was not disposed to conversation just now. For one
thing she was deeply offended. And at the best of times
she was a difficult woman, and age and infirmity had
made her morose. Her long life as a reigning sovereign
had been neither more nor less than an orgy of despotic
power. And such a condition does not make for human
amenity, particularly in the case of one in whom a love of
tyranny has become second nature.</p>

<p>The plain truth was, that Gloriana was hard and cruel.
And these three men were only too well aware of the
fact. Each of them felt a grave uneasiness in regard to
the fate that was likely to overtake the man for whose
life and liberty they were there to plead.</p>

<p>At last, the tapestried door of the chamber opened to
admit the returning Cecil, who gravely ushered in the
culprit.</p>

<p>The playwright entered the room with a serenity, an
unconcern that could only have been exhibited in such
circumstances by one who breathes an air which is not the
common ether of mankind. The Queen, a close enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>observer when it pleased her to be so, was impressed by
the almost majestic simplicity of this man. His three
friends, so jealous for his reputation, could only rejoice
at it.</p>

<p>“Master Shakespeare,” said the Queen, arrogantly, “it
had not been our intention to hear you in your own defence.
We had meant to leave the whole matter to those
who know in what sort to deal with it. But three very
good and true friends of yours have come forward to
plead your cause: one, as I understand, an honest man
who follows your own calling, has even gone to the length
of offering his own life in exchange for yours; and my
Lord Pembroke and Sir Walter Raleigh each offers the
half of his fortune as the price of your ransom.”</p>

<p>For the moment the self-possession of the poet forsook
him, so deeply was he moved by the loyalty and
the self-sacrificing devotion of his friends. He lowered
his head in the manner of one completely overcome.
The sensitive lips trembled, the deep-set eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>“You have good friends, Master Shakespeare.” The
tone of the Queen was so matter-of-fact, that she might
have been merely discussing a plain affair of business.
“And no man can have friends so true as these and so
honorable in reputation without having a character sufficiently
worthy to entitle him to them. Therefore, it is
for this reason, and for none other, that I have decided
to hear you in your own behalf. But, pray understand, I
hold out no prospect of leniency. You have been guilty
of such wicked folly that I do not doubt that a charge of
high treason will lie against you.”</p>

<p>By this time, the playwright was once more completely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>master of himself. He stood to confront the Queen simply
and without fear.</p>

<p>“Let us hear your defence, Master Shakespeare, if defence
you will venture to make.”</p>

<p>“Your grace,” said the player, in his gentle voice, “on
my own part, I offer no defence. Freely and fully I accept
all responsibility for any hurt I have done to justice.
But having done none that I know, I take my stand upon
the innocence of my intention.”</p>

<p>The light of anger flamed in the Queen’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t use so many words, sirrah,” she said, sharply.
“Come to the issue. I am a plain woman, and I ask
for plain words and few. For what reason, I will ask
you, have you embraced these devious ways?”</p>

<p>The player met with calm eyes the harsh glance of the
Sovereign.</p>

<p>“If it be treason, your grace, to befriend the innocent,”
he said, “I will gladly pay the penalty of my crime.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Queen sparkled ominously.</p>

<p>“The innocent, sirrah! Pray, what do you mean by the
innocent? Is it the part of innocence, I ask you, to engage
in a plot to take away my life?”</p>

<p>“No, your grace,” said the player. “And may it never
be permitted to one of your subjects to say otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Then may I ask why you take the part of those who
have done so?”</p>

<p>“I have but taken the part, your grace, of one accused
wrongfully.”</p>

<p>“Do not impugn the Queen’s justice, sirrah!”</p>

<p>“God forbid! But, in this instance, I make so bold as
to affirm that a grievous miscarriage has occurred.”</p>

<p>“God’s blood, sirrah!” cried the Queen, “I would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>you be wary. If you dare to impugn the integrity of our
courts, and you cannot make good your ill words in
every particular, you shall make heavy payment for such
a contumacy.”</p>

<p>The player showed neither hesitation nor alarm, yet the
hostility of the Queen’s demeanor must have daunted
all save the very stout of heart.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me, your grace,” he said, “to impugn
the integrity of that which no man in this realm should
ever call in question. But no human assembly can be
wholly free of error. And in this most grievous matter,
I swear to your grace before God that there has been a
truly terrible miscarriage of justice.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Queen grew dark with menace.</p>

<p>“Prove your words, sirrah. And if ye fail, God help
you.”</p>

<p>“Readily will I prove them,” said the player, with a certain
triumph in his voice. “I hold the proof in my
hand.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he struck his hand into his doublet and
produced the written confession of Simon Heriot. He
gave the paper to the Queen.</p>

<p>With a cold fury sparkling in her eyes, Elizabeth
handed the document to the Lord Treasurer. She commanded
him to read it to her.</p>

<p>Surprise, excitement, incredulity were evoked in that
tyrannical bosom by the minister’s perusal of this document.
But not for a moment did her native keenness of
mind desert her.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my lord,” she said, “is this an honest and
genuine document?”</p>

<p>Cecil scrutinized the paper closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“It bears no evidence, your grace, as far as one can at
present see,” said the Lord Treasurer, cautiously, “of its
being a counterfeit. But it would be well, perhaps, to
have further and more expert testimony upon the subject.”</p>

<p>“Let this man, Simon Heriot, be at once summoned,”
said the Queen.</p>

<p>“Alas! your grace,” said the player, “Simon Heriot has
been ten days dead. This is his dying testimony.”</p>

<p>The Queen shook her head suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I like not this matter,” she said. “Who are the
others named in this conspiracy?”</p>

<p>“One William Muir, your grace, and one Robert Grisewood.”</p>

<p>“Let them be brought to me instantly.”</p>

<p>“Unhappily, your grace, William Muir has fled the
country.”</p>

<p>“Has he so!” said the Queen, sternly. “Then what of
this man Grisewood? So lately as yesterday, with my
own eyes, I saw him here. My lord, let the man be
brought to us immediately.”</p>

<p>Cecil left the room in order to carry out these instructions.
But in a few minutes, he had returned with
the information that Grisewood was not to be seen anywhere
within the precincts of the palace. Having regard,
however, to the great urgency of the matter, the Lord
Treasurer announced that he had already dispatched a
troop of horse to fetch the man from his lodgings in the
Strand.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said the Queen, grimly.</p>

<p>With a curt nod, she dismissed all save Cecil from her
presence, saying she would confer with them again
presently.</p>

there to abide the issue. Long they waited. It
was a far cry in those days from Richmond to the
Strand and back again. Shakespeare alone was without
concern. The others were gravely uneasy. The Queen’s
vengeful temper was much to be feared, and Cecil was
by no means a person to be trusted.</p>

<p>The friends of the player were convinced that he had
adduced a genuine proof of the innocence of Gervase
Heriot. They were satisfied, moreover, that he
had been inspired by no other motive than an overmastering
desire to affirm justice, truth and mercy.
Nevertheless, the turn things were taking made them
painfully anxious in regard to the outcome of the whole
affair.</p>

<p>The Queen, for all the native vigor of her understanding,
was a mass of prejudice and caprice. She was bitterly
resentful of the inconvenience that had been caused
by the player’s wanton interference. Again, a man like
Grisewood, with his back to the wall, could be trusted to
fight tooth and nail for his life. He would lie, that was
certain. He was bound to deny the authenticity of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>slender evidence that had been adduced in a manner so
fortuitous.</p>

<p>The upshot was likely to be that the affair would resolve
itself into a battle between a villain and an honest
man. It would become a question in that event as to
whose word the Queen would accept. Already the player
was out of favor. And when it came to a question of
holding the balance even between him and another, when
it came to weighing judicially the words of each, it was
most probable that the mind of a capricious woman would
prove incapable of giving him fair play.</p>

<p>Yes, the friends of the player, as they sat silent in the
Queen’s antechamber to await the arrival of Grisewood
were uneasy indeed. The man was known as a cunning,
plausible, unscrupulous adventurer. He was not likely
to be over-nice as to the means he used to save his neck.
And one and all felt that already the case was prejudged.</p>

<p>Presently Pembroke and Raleigh, who were officers of
the Household, withdrew. The playwright and his friend
the tragedian were left together. The hearts of both
were too full for speech. The time passed very slowly.
Each hour seemed interminable. The day wore on but
still there came no summons to the Queen’s presence.
After a while, food was brought to them at the instance of
a friendly official. But they were without appetite, and
did not touch it. Their minds were wholly preoccupied
with the subject of life and death.</p>

<p>In all that long time, which seemed interminable, not a
word was exchanged between the playwright and the
tragedian. Yet in the manner of a pair of children, they
sat very close together, the hand of Burbage holding that
of his friend. He was his elder brother, his protector; he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>felt an overmastering desire to shield that shy and delicate
spirit from the harsh rebuffs of fate.</p>

<p>At last, about four o’clock of the afternoon, came the
dread summons to the Queen. It was conveyed by the
Lord Treasurer in person. There was nothing to learn
from that lofty and formal mien. The measured deportment,
the detached air told nothing. He who so often
was called to be the arbiter of life and death in the daily
routine of his high office betrayed not the least emotion.
Indeed, the grim question now at issue appeared to touch
him not at all.</p>

<p>The Queen was taking her ease on a gorgeous gilt
couch. One of her ladies, who was working a sampler in
silk, was seated on a low stool at her side. She was a
dark and handsome young woman with restless, brilliant
and piercing eyes. As soon as the playwright entered the
room, they met his in a kind of challenge, half of cynical
interest, half of mockery. A slow, rather insolent smile
curled her lips. For a very brief instant, the poet was
obviously disconcerted. But almost at once, he had exercised
the whole force of his will and was able to attend
that other woman who held his life in her hand.</p>

<p>The Queen sat up on her couch.</p>

<p>“Master Shakespeare,” she said, “I have to inform you
that the man, Grisewood, is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” gasped the player.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Queen, “he is dead. He has been found
at his lodging with his throat cut. And there can be little
doubt, as I am given to understand, that he has died by
his own hand.”</p>

<p>The player stood in silence, looking straight in front of
him. There came a violent surge and onrush of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>thoughts. In the sensitive and generous mind, relief for
the good riddance of a bad man was tempered with an
emotion of pity for an end so ignoble.</p>

<p>“I have to say this, Master Shakespeare.” The voice
of the Queen, which sounded very far away, broke in
upon the heavy tumult of his thoughts. “The death of
this man, Grisewood, removed a most material witness.
He alone could have proved or disproved your statement.”</p>

<p>By now, however, the playwright had regained full
command of himself. Calmly, he sustained the force of
the Queen’s gaze. The somber yet wonderful eyes were
fixed on the raddled and rather peevish face.</p>

<p>“Under the favor of your grace,” he said, speaking very
slowly and in the manner of one who chooses his words
with the utmost care, “Sir Robert Grisewood has already
attested to the truth of the statement which I have
made.”</p>

<p>“In what way, sirrah? By what means?” said the
Queen, sharply.</p>

<p>“By the taking of his own life,” said the playwright.
“It is a clear confession of the knowledge that he is undone.”</p>

<p>“How should he have any such knowledge?”</p>

<p>“He was present yesterday, your grace, in the pavilion,
when I rehearsed the story of his crime. I marked his
livid face among the audience. It is one I shall never
forget.”</p>

<p>The Queen nodded her head, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“My eyes were fixed, your grace, upon that man’s face
when I said I held the proof of his guilt. I saw his cheek
turn to the color of his ruff. And by that I knew there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>was confirmation of my statement had confirmation been
required.”</p>

<p>“The man was an arrant coward,” said the Queen, contemptuously.
“But such evidence of his guilt does not
convince me. How say you, my lord?” She turned to
Cecil peremptorily.</p>

<p>The statesman did not answer the question immediately.
For the moment, that powerful and deep-seeing
mind was much preoccupied. And when answer he did,
it was with the air of a man enfolded by a sense of profound
and settled conviction.</p>

<p>“By leave of your grace,” he said, “and under your
good favor, I am bound to confess that I share the view
of this matter which is held by Master Shakespeare. In
my humble opinion, the death of this man in such circumstances
is an irrefragable evidence of his guilt.”</p>

<p>The Queen was now sitting very upright. The lean
features had assumed a look of sharpest inquiry. A
round oath fell from her lips.</p>

<p>“By God’s body, my lord, I begin to think you are in
the right!”</p>

<p>She was a woman of capricious temper. The milk of
human kindness flowed an uncertain stream in that sterile
heart. But her ears were never quite deaf to the voice of
reason. Moreover, there were occasions when a sense of
justice overtook her.</p>

<p>It began almost to seem that this occasion was likely to
be one of them.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my lord,” she demanded, “is this to say
that you accept, as a matter of sober verity, that the
handwriting of Simon Heriot is contained in this
paper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, your grace, I am of that opinion.”</p>

<p>“You are satisfied that the man, Simon Heriot, wrote
this confession with his own hand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your grace, that is the view I hold. In the first
place, I have taken the opportunity to compare the writing
in the paper with that of another document in the
same hand. And may it please your grace that I am fully
satisfied that they are one and the same. And, further, I
will add that the death in such circumstances of such a
man convinces me that a grievous miscarriage of justice
has been perpetrated in the case of the young man, Gervase
Heriot.”</p>

<p>Another round oath rose to the lips of the Queen. She
got up impulsively from her couch. The heart of a
woman had begun to stir in that withered and grotesque
frame.</p>

<p>“My lord, if that is your opinion, we must go further
into this,” she said. “Upon my life, we must not
send to the ax those who have done nothing to deserve
it.”</p>

<p>“To that, your grace, I say amen with all my heart,”
said the Lord Treasurer, assuming an air of simple
human kindness, which really became him very well
indeed.</p>

<p>“Let this young man, Heriot, attend us here and now,”
said the Queen.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, both Mr. Heriot and Mistress Feversham
have already been removed to the Tower,” said the
Lord Treasurer, “until the pleasure of your Majesty be
further known.”</p>

<p>“Let the young man be brought to us at once,” said the
Queen. “And the girl also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>“The commands of your Majesty shall be obeyed,”
said the Lord Treasurer. “Both prisoners shall be sent
for immediately.”</p>

<p>With a low bow, the minister quitted the room.</p>

<p>A subtle but marked change had suddenly taken place
in the Queen’s manner. She turned to the playwright
with a certain kindness in the hard eyes.</p>

<p>“Belike, sirrah,” she said, “your play may prove a
comedy, after all.”</p>

<p>The playwright stood before her in silence with bent
head. In the strong frame, with its tense outlines, was a
profound humility which the Queen was wholly at a loss
to understand.</p>

<p>“How say you, sirrah? Would you not have it so?”</p>

<p>“Life is never a comedy, your grace,” said the playwright,
speaking very gently, almost as one who thinks
aloud.</p>

<p>“A dark saying,” said the Queen, “How say you,
Mary?” She turned, with an ironical air, to the young
woman who was working so busily upon the sampler.
“Perhaps Master Shakespeare will expound it for us out
of the infinite store of his wisdom. You don’t find life a
very tragic matter, eh, my girl, you who have the whole
world at your feet?”</p>

<p>The august lady gave her gentlewoman a light box on
the ear.</p>

<p>Mistress Fytton, whose dark and brilliant beauty had
its sinister aspect, rose from her stool with a sigh and a
little laugh.</p>

<p>“It is the business of a poet, your grace, to be melancholy,”
said Mistress Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had not thought of that,” said the Queen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>“But I suspect, Miss Malapert, you know more of poets
than I do.”</p>

<p>“God forbid, your grace,” Mistress Mary made a deep
but mocking curtsy.</p>

<p>“You impudent hussy!”</p>

<p>And this time, the royal lady gave her gentlewoman so
sound a box on the ear, that it rang through the room.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ERVASE and Anne had been taken the previous
evening from Richmond to the Tower. They
were placed in a prison as dismal as on that
occasion of their first meeting, which now seemed so
far away in the past. But Gervase was better able now
to prepare himself for the grim fate that too surely
awaited him.</p>

<p>Both these children of destiny had had many weeks
in which to make ready for that which was now to befall
them. Their souls were numb. Long ago, they had
given up all hope of life. Indeed, they had almost
given up all desire of it, such had been their sufferings.
The only boon they now craved of Providence was that
they might be allowed to die together.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon of the first day of
their imprisonment, word was brought to them that the
Queen desired to see them at once, that they were to
be carried before her immediately, and that she herself
would there and then decide their fate.</p>

<p>They looked for no clemency. Unknown to each
other, the prisoners were borne again to the palace at
Richmond, each in a separate closed carriage, jealously
guarded by soldiers with drawn swords. The gorgeous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>sunlight streamed in through the windows of their
coaches, the dust of midsummer whirled around the
wheels, but their minds were withdrawn from all outward
and visible things. They felt they were going to
their death. God grant that it be given to them to embrace
it together!</p>

<p>On their arrival at the palace, shortly after six o’clock,
they were taken at once to an antechamber, which was
next the Queen’s own apartment. Here they met again.
And the solemn-faced, harsh-looking men who had them
in their care had enough humanity to stand apart, while
Anne yielded herself to the arms of Gervase.</p>

<p>“Have you the dagger?” she whispered, shaking convulsively.</p>

<p>“Alas! they have found it,” said Gervase. “If only
I had it now, I would plunge it into your heart ... my
life!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if only you had it!”</p>

<p>They had not long to wait for the dread summons to
the Queen. All too soon appeared the Lord Treasurer.
At once, he ushered them into the room where the
Queen sat.</p>

<p>Gervase had cast off his disguise. No longer was he
the aged and bearded Italian music master, but a trim
and rather fine young man, dressed very soberly, to be
sure, yet affecting a style not out of place at that Court,
of which less than a year ago he had been an ornament.</p>

<p>Anne remained, however, in her charming boy’s dress
of the previous day. The lean grace of outline was rendered
more poignant by the thin brown cheeks, the bright,
grave eyes, the head of close-clipt curls. In the wistfulness
of this frail figure, chastened by the long night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>of the soul, there was a pathos which struck at the
hearts of all who beheld it.</p>

<p>Besides, the Queen and the Lord Treasurer, there was
one other person in the room. Gervase and Anne, for
all that they were passing through a nightmare of dull
terror, were sensible of a presence in the background.
It was their friend the play-actor, grave of look and yet
unfearing; gentle, pitiful, and yet secure of soul. Somehow,
the sight of him who had done so much, who had
put his fortunes to the proof, nay, even life itself, that
he might help them, moved these hapless lovers to new
courage.</p>

<p>From the gentle face of this man, all compassion, all
tenderness, their eyes sought that of the Queen. That
was a very different countenance. And yet, as those
hawklike eyes met theirs, a curious light ran in them.
It was almost as if, in spite of herself, Elizabeth had
been moved by the sight of this shadowy, yet dauntless
thing, this <i>Rosalind</i> who yesterday had charmed her
with her coquetry, her grace, her sorcery of voice and
look.</p>

<p>“Mistress Feversham”&mdash;the harsh voice seemed to assault
their ears, so sharp it was, so merciless&mdash;“I am
given to understand you are a woman. But let me say
that, in the moment I saw you first, I knew that you were
that.” Here the voice fell away with the oddest suddenness.
A tense moment passed in which it seemed
that the sovereign could hardly trust herself to speak.
“And, by God, you are a brave woman! ... a very
brave woman, even if you are a very froward one.”</p>

<p>The Queen turned abruptly to the Lord Treasurer.
There was a sour and cruel smile on the thin lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>“Do we understand,” she said, “that there is a boon
Mistress Feversham would crave at our hands?”</p>

<p>A silence followed the question&mdash;a silence in which
Elizabeth and her minister looked without pity upon
the shrinking pair who stood before them.</p>

<p>In the next instant, Anne had cast herself on her
knees at the Queen’s feet.</p>

<p>But it was left to Gervase to speak. And he spoke
as one who proudly asks a favor to which he feels he
has clearly established a claim.</p>

<p>“Your grace.” The young man sank to his knees.
“We crave of your mercy that we be permitted to die
together.”</p>

<p>The Queen’s answer was a swift glance at the Lord
Treasurer. And then, perhaps, it may have been that
she felt a sudden sting of remorse for the cruel nature
of the play she was enacting. Yet the face of her adviser
was as cold as stone. It bore no trace of feeling. And
it may have been that such an impassiveness smote the
heart of one who, after all, was a woman, with all a
woman’s emotions.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, as it seemed, the Queen turned her eyes
from Cecil toward that other, that more human witness
of the scene. Unconsciously, as if at the beck of an invisible
power, her imperious gaze sought the mild one
of him whose life was passed in the making of plays.
His face, averted from a sight it could not endure, was
melted with tears.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, something stirred in the Queen’s heart.
It was such a pang of nature as had not touched it for
many a long year. The time was surely at hand in
which to make an end of the cruel comedy. Upon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>quick impulse in which the woman alone bore a part,
and the tyrannical arbitress of life and death had no
share, she raised the unhappy girl in her arms and gravely
kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>“You are a brave thing,” cried the harsh, rough voice.
“By God, you are a brave thing. You shall suffer no
more. Our pardon shall be granted to you, and also to
this young man against whom as we are informed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the sentence so fraught with destiny was never
finished. The frail form had grown stiff and cold in the
arms of the Queen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T happened that one afternoon of early autumn,
William Shakespeare rode out to Richmond, as he
had done so many times of late, and sought poor
Anne where she still lay in the house of a good friend.
Her bed was in a charming chamber, from which she
could see the sunlit Thames winding through its green
valley. Gervase, thin and careworn, was kneeling by
the bed, and his arms were holding its frail occupant.</p>

<p>For many days Anne had lain between life and death.
But the fire of youth was in her veins. She had fine
courage, moreover, pure strength of body, therefore
Nature fought for her. And in the end Nature prevailed.
Yet long after life itself had conquered, it was feared
that reason, the sovereign goddess, would be dethroned
forever in that finely tempered spirit.</p>

<p>Her friends never gave up hope. Many were the
dark and cruel days in which she hovered upon the verge
of that abyss, by comparison with which death itself is
more than kind. And at last, very slowly, very fitfully,
the wisdom, the patience, the devotion of those that
watched over her met with their reward.</p>

<p>When at last it became known that the grimmest of all
her perils was past, there were those of her friends who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>laid upon a certain famous man as being the foremost
of their number, the happy task of bearing the tidings
to the Queen that all was well with poor <i>Rosalind</i>.</p>

<p>The player, humble-minded as he was, would have
been the last man in the world to arrogate to himself
any such privilege. But the insistence of Anne’s friends
was strong. Well they knew the valiant part this man
had played. Moreover, the Queen, it seemed, had caused
many inquiries to be made of “the brave thing” who
was fighting the sternest of all her battles. The heart
of the woman had been moved by the gallant story. It
may have been that Gloriana felt that honor had been
done to the sex of which she herself was a foremost
ornament. She may have felt that even in an heroic age
here was a fitting mother for heroes.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the heart of the woman had been
melted. And that golden afternoon, William Shakespeare
was the bearer of glad tidings from the Queen
in her palace at Greenwich. She was graciously pleased
to grant a full and free pardon to Gervase Heriot and
Anne Feversham.</p>

<p>There was a look of joy in the face of the player as
he entered her chamber with the high news. He found
her propped up with pillows, thin as a ghost, but her
eyes were no longer wild. By the side of the bed knelt
Gervase. One arm clasped the frail form that now was
all his life; and in one hand he held the newly printed
and authentic version of the tragical history of “Romeo
and Juliet” which he was reading to Anne in his gentle
voice.</p>

<p>“Ah, here is the author himself.”</p>

<p>Gervase laid the book down on the counterpane and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>rose with a shy smile. The lovers greeted their friend,
to whom they owed everything, with shining eyes. The
player’s apology for so unseasonably disturbing them was
humorously tender, but such news admitted no delay.</p>

<p>“I am the bearer of great tidings,” the player cried.
“All is forgiven.”</p>

<p>There came a silence, and then “All!” gasped Anne.</p>

<p>“All,” said the player. “All is forgiven you by Gloriana
in her clemency.”</p>

<p>Again a silence.</p>

<p>“But my father!”</p>

<p>The three simple words seemed almost to tear at the
heart of the poet.</p>

<p>“All is forgiven him also.”</p>

<p>That also was true.</p>

<p>“But why does he not come to me? Is it that he will
not?”</p>

<p>Alas, that was a question the poet dare not answer.
The plain truth was he knew not in what sort to answer
it. As soon as the Queen had been apprised of Sir
John Feversham’s complete innocence, almost her first
act had been to order his immediate release from the
Tower. But even when a free pardon had been granted
to him and he was once more at liberty and no longer in
danger of losing his head, he was yet a very unhappy
man. He was as one completely overborne by the sense
of his daughter’s crime. Even as she lay in her extremity,
he could not be induced to visit her, nor even to
speak of her. And now that the awful force of her
suffering was past, and wan and spent, yet with mind
at last clear and reasonable, poor Anne waited in vain
for her father’s coming. A powerful nature had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>wounded to the depths. It was not the act of filial
treachery that Sir John Feversham found unforgivable;
it was the disloyalty to the august sovereign whom he
had served all his days that he found impossible to overpass.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that one man, and he the most devoted
among all the friends of Mistress Anne had had the wit
to realize the why and wherefore of this. Shakespeare
saw clearly that even if the outraged father had been
able to forgive, the loyal and devoted subject yet found
it impossible so to do. And no sooner did this tender-hearted
maker of plays realize that such was the case
than daring greatly he went to the Queen.</p>

<p>“That is a matter, Master Shakespeare, in which we
may never be able to move,” was the Queen’s answer.
“And yet perhaps....”</p>

<p>For the present, the player felt he must rest content
with that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the author of the tragical history of
“Romeo and Juliet” had to suffer the entreaties of this
pair of young lovers that he should remain and read to
them a portion of that wondrous tale of love which he
had given to the world in the spring tide of his own
youth.</p>

<p>The poet was not proof against the importunities of
these children of destiny whom he had come to love with
a father’s tenderness. Therefore he took his book presently
from the hands of Gervase and sat at the bed foot.
In his low and clear voice he began to read the immortal
story.</p>

<p>Hand in hand, their fingers intertwined, Anne and
Gervase listened with strange rapture. That recital was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>ever afterwards to be a landmark in their lives. The
romance which ravished their ears had its parallel in
their own experience. They could live again their hours
of supremest exaltation. Was it not all distilled in those
magical pages? It has been the destiny of this story of
ill-starred love to evoke the wide world over the tears
of those who have known a great passion. But here
were two who had greatly loved to whom even the author’s
own rendering of the exquisite story brought no
tears.</p>

<p>To such a nadir of the spirit had these twin souls
descended that it seemed to them then that they could
never weep again. They could never weep again, yet
were they very far from being unhappy. Still, even
now they could hardly realize the nature of the miracle
that had happened to them. Gervase was a free man;
life and liberty had been granted to him; Anne had been
given back her reason; and henceforward the only fetters
they were to know were to be the silken one each
imposed upon the other. Yet it was all very hard to
realize!</p>

<p>While the poet continued to read his noble invention
he was gravely preoccupied. His thoughts were forever
straying from the creatures of his fancy to that wan and
fragile thing propped up with pillows who looked as if
she could never smile nor weep again. If only Sir John
Feversham could come to his daughter now! If only the
forgiveness of that just man could be granted to her!
Even as he read, the words of the Queen were ever in
his ears. “It is a matter, Master Shakespeare, in which
we may never be able to move. And yet perhaps...!”</p>

<p>The poet, however, had wrought better than he knew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>His plea to Gloriana had not fallen barren on those august
ears. The girl had earned absolution by her courage,
nor had the Queen been slow to make her pleasure
known to Sir John Feversham.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that the poet was still seated at
the bed foot reading aloud to these children of destiny
his entrancing tale of love when a servant entered the
room. A few words were whispered into the poet’s ear.
And then with a sudden startled smile, William Shakespeare
laid down the book on the bed and went hastily
out of the room.</p>

<p>It seemed that a miracle had happened. Sir John
Feversham had arrived at that house, was waiting below
and was desirous of seeing his daughter.</p>

<p>Only a very little while was William Shakespeare
gone from the room. He had soon returned, to usher
into the sunlit chamber a man who looked strangely
bent and old. His hair was perfectly white. Sir John
Feversham had changed much in appearance. And the
events of more than one lifetime had been crowded
into poor Anne’s experience since last she had seen her
father.</p>

<p>At first she did not realize who the frail man was with
the snow-white hair who had come into the room.</p>

<p>It was not indeed until this grave personage informed
Anne that he was come from the Queen with a
present and a message that she recognized her father.
And even then it may have been the slow and deep melancholy
of the voice that told her. She gave a little wild
cry, and clutched Gervase with a sudden pang of terror.
But there was nought in her father’s voice nor in his
bearing to inspire it now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>
<p>With a gesture all humility, as one who knows that the
will of man is little, and that man himself is hardly more
than a puppet in the hands of fate, Sir John Feversham
knelt by the bed and gave his daughter a kiss on the
lips.</p>

<p>“It is the token of the Queen’s forgiveness,” he said,
“which I am commanded to bring you.”</p>

<p>Anne shivered. Dry-eyed and in silence, her arms were
flung round her father’s neck. It was as if she also had
come to understand that she was no more than a plaything
in the hands of fate.</p>

<p>The Queen’s messenger rose from his knees. And now
for all his look of frailty which was almost pitiful, he
had the tense and vital air of a man of affairs who is
proud to serve a great sovereign.</p>

<p>“Further I am bidden by the Queen’s majesty,” he
said in his slow and melancholy speech which was yet like
a fine and rare music, “to bestow upon you, Mistress Anne
Feversham, in her name, this chaplet of pearls.”</p>

<p>As Sir John spoke he took a small shagreen case out of
the lining of his cloak. It contained a small necklace.</p>

<p>“At the Queen’s behest, thus do I place it round your
throat, Mistress Anne Feversham. Moreover, it is her
Majesty’s express command that you be well and strong
again by Twelfth Night, since noon of that day is the
hour her Majesty has appointed for the celebration of
your nuptials with Mr. Gervase Heriot in the Chapel of
her grandfather within the Abbey at Westminster. The
Queen hopes herself to be present on the occasion. And
I am further to inform you that on the eve of that day
Mr. William Shakespeare, to whose efforts on your behalf
the late signal acts of the Royal clemency are wholly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>due, has undertaken to present a new interlude to the
Queen and the ladies and gentlemen of her Court. His
former ones, the Queen commands me to say,”&mdash;Sir John
Feversham bowed to the playwright who with a grave
smile bowed to him again&mdash;“have been much admired.”</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
